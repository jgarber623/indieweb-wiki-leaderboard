I did use doveadm to encrypt a long random password though so it isn’t stored in the file as plain text (not that it really matters anyway, perhaps if this was a shared machine).\n      passdb {\n    driver = static\n    args = password={SCHEME}[REDACTED]\n  }\n    \n    I have email for two domains on my host so my userdb looks like:\n      userdb {  driver = static\n    args = uid=999 gid=99 mail_location=maildir:/path/to/Mail/%u:LAYOUT=fs:INBOX=/path/to/Mail/%u/Inbox\n  }\n    \n    My postfix setup is using the “filesystem” maildir layout - I can’t remember doing that on purpose so I presume it was the default when I set it up. I also had to include the INBOX arg as otherwise I got all my other folders mapped, but no actual inbox.\n    With this setup, since the username isn’t used for static auth, I use the domain as the username in my client and it maps to the right mailbox. I could (should?) tweak that so the username is the email address and then pull the domain from that, but it doesn’t really matter.\n  \n\nI will see how this goes, keep an eye on the logs and perhaps think of further ways to lock it down; Maybe limiting number of clients or perhaps only running Dovecot when I need it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTags: program"

There is more I didn’t get to and <em>yet more</em> on <a href=\"https://canvas-story.bbcrewind.co.uk/6-music-albums-of-the-year-2022/\">6Music’s top ten album list</a>. So much music this year; Semi-related, voted for the obvious choice on <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/4lT9StjQ1qVvnbqBjB0k21f/radio-1s-hottest-record-of-the-year-2022-vote-for-your-favourite\">Radio 1’s hottest record of the year</a> (Charli XCX).</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n<strong>Shygirl: Nymph</strong> - Shlut and Firefly are my favourites.</li>\n  <li>\n<strong>Flohio: Out of Heart</strong> - Speed of Light is just ace.</li>\n  <li>\n<strong>Big Joanie: Back Home</strong> - Your words is easily the standout track for me.</li>\n  <li>\n<strong>Loyle Carter: Hugo</strong> - Nobody Knows (Ladas Road) is the easy/obvious choice. As of yet, I’m not enjoying this album as much as Not Waving, But Drowning.</li>\n  <li>\n<strong>Mall Grab: What I Breathe</strong> - Love Reigns is my favourite. Despite being a big Nia Archives fan, that track is not my favourite. Times Change is also very good. I should listen to this album more. This is an elder daughter artist recommendation from a long time a go that I didn’t give enough listens to until they popped up again on ChillDaBeats.</li>\n  <li>\n<strong>Skullcrusher: Quiet the room</strong> - Whatever Fits Together is just utterly beautiful and ethereal. It is a quiet album, not a party album.</li>\n  <li>\n<strong>Carly Rae Jepson: The Loneliest Time</strong> - A younger daughter recommendation. Probably the slower tracks are better, like Go Find Yourself or Whatever (which is one track, not two). Maybe also Surrender My Heart. But also, sorry to my daughter, but I do prefer Taylor Swift (even though I didn’t get to her new album here).</li>\n  <li>\n<strong>Friction: After Dark</strong> - Into the Night and Weed &amp; Wine (Relax, Rewind) because the name goes well with Chase &amp; Status’s Weed &amp; Rum. Good to Me is great too. I have lots of love for Friction.</li>\n  <li>\n<strong>Totally Enormous Extinct Dinosaurs: When the Lights Go</strong> - Never Seen You Dance (Gives me big 1975 / Matty Healy vibes. Also you can see where the piano styles come from on the Confidence Man remix). Sound &amp; Rhythm? Yes.</li>\n  <li>\n<strong>The Big Moon: Here is Everything</strong> - Trouble is the standout, but Wide Eyes, and Daydreaming are ok too.</li>\n  <li>\n<strong>Jockstrap: I love you Jennifer B</strong> - I am not cool nor young enough to appreciate this.

            "value": "Pretty much a quick checklist of stuff I’ve listened to this month. There is more I didn’t get to and yet more on 6Music’s top ten album list. So much music this year; Semi-related, voted for the obvious choice on Radio 1’s hottest record of the year (Charli XCX).\n\n  Shygirl: Nymph - Shlut and Firefly are my favourites.\n  Flohio: Out of Heart - Speed of Light is just ace.\n  Big Joanie: Back Home - Your words is easily the standout track for me.\n  Loyle Carter: Hugo - Nobody Knows (Ladas Road) is the easy/obvious choice. As of yet, I’m not enjoying this album as much as Not Waving, But Drowning.\n  Mall Grab: What I Breathe - Love Reigns is my favourite. Despite being a big Nia Archives fan, that track is not my favourite. Times Change is also very good. I should listen to this album more. This is an elder daughter artist recommendation from a long time a go that I didn’t give enough listens to until they popped up again on ChillDaBeats.\n  Skullcrusher: Quiet the room - Whatever Fits Together is just utterly beautiful and ethereal. It is a quiet album, not a party album.\n  Carly Rae Jepson: The Loneliest Time - A younger daughter recommendation. Probably the slower tracks are better, like Go Find Yourself or Whatever (which is one track, not two). Maybe also Surrender My Heart. But also, sorry to my daughter, but I do prefer Taylor Swift (even though I didn’t get to her new album here).\n  Friction: After Dark - Into the Night and Weed & Wine (Relax, Rewind) because the name goes well with Chase & Status’s Weed & Rum. Good to Me is great too. I have lots of love for Friction.\n  Totally Enormous Extinct Dinosaurs: When the Lights Go - Never Seen You Dance (Gives me big 1975 / Matty Healy vibes. Also you can see where the piano styles come from on the Confidence Man remix). Sound & Rhythm? Yes.\n  The Big Moon: Here is Everything - Trouble is the standout, but Wide Eyes, and Daydreaming are ok too.\n  Jockstrap: I love you Jennifer B - I am not cool nor young enough to appreciate this. Kind of an electronic Fiona Apple?\nActually, I realised I’ve been here before and listened to their 2018 EP and I think I felt the same then: It’s a bit like eating a strong and odd tasting food, really interesting, but not sure I like it.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTags: owtlelse"
