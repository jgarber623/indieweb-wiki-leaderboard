It was raining, but it was still great. A really nice route with long stretches away from traffic and a bit of woodland as well. It seemed to go perfectly. When A got back from doing the school-run (now much longer, another story, but hence the time to get out for 10k) I’d been back a short-while and was ready to go out with her. We did a shorter run and I could feel that my knee felt a bit iffy, but it was a nice steady run and also seemed to go ok.</p>\n<p>Not long afterwards though my knee started feeling bad and then proceeded to get worse and worse. I quickly went from thinking “I’ll have tomorrow off running”, to “I’m having at least a month off running”. I was gutted - it just felt so unfair. I think I’ve screwed it the worse I have ever done and I thought it was bad enough when I knackered it at the start of the year. On the day of the injury I couldn’t walk across the room and had to hop across. For the first couple of days I couldn’t help walk the dogs. That went down well. Two weeks later I could walk with a hobble/limp and my knee was still a bit swollen. Three weeks later I managed to walk 10k, which was pretty cool, but with a bit of limp by the end of it and it felt sore afterwards - although was no worse the next day.

Somehow I have mostly stayed sane during the past four weeks. Hopefully I can at least start getting back into some kind of yoga soon though.

Although I think perhaps I should admit defeat on running, but on the other hand <a href=\"https://atomicules.co.uk/2020/10/20/All-of-my-eggs-in-two-shoes.html\">what else can I do</a>?</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<ul class=\"post-tags\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li class=\"tags\">Tags: <ul><li><a class=\"p-category\" href=\"https://atomicules.co.uk/push.html\">push</a></li></ul>\n</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t</ul>",
