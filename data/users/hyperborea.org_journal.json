Think of Mastodon as a type of account (like email)</strong>, and the server you sign up with as where your account lives (like Gmail or Yahoo). Ex. I’m <a href=\"https://wandering.shop/@KelsonV\">@KelsonV@wandering.shop</a>, so I have a Wandering.Shop account that speaks Mastodon. (Mastodonian?)</p>\n<p><strong>6. Finally, There’s a whole <a href=\"https://joinfediverse.wiki/\">“Fediverse”</a> out there</strong> of other software that talks together. Pixelfed is a photo service like Instagram, Lemmy does link sharing/forums like Reddit, PeerTube does videos, etc. And you can do things like follow &amp; reply to Pixelfed accounts on Mastodon.</p>\n<div class=\"lj-moods-meta\"></div>",

Fortunately there are lists of interesting posters like fedi.directory and curators of recommendations like @feditips@mstdn.social.\n5. Think of Mastodon as a type of account (like email), and the server you sign up with as where your account lives (like Gmail or Yahoo). Ex. I’m @KelsonV@wandering.shop, so I have a Wandering.Shop account that speaks Mastodon. (Mastodonian?)\n6. Finally, There’s a whole “Fediverse” out there of other software that talks together. Pixelfed is a photo service like Instagram, Lemmy does link sharing/forums like Reddit, PeerTube does videos, etc. And you can do things like follow & reply to Pixelfed accounts on Mastodon."
