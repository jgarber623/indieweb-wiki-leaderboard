I'll also post the occasional blog post. These posts will mostly be technical in nature, but will also just focus on whatever I've got going on at any given time.\n    If you want to drop me a line, email me at the address in the footer.\n    Indie Web\n    I am huge supporter of the Indie Web movement, and thus make use of a lot of the principals and features that drive it. I encourage anyone and everyone to participate, and help take back the internet from the monopolies who try to keep us subjugated.\n\n\t\tBlog Posts\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tNo alt text\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tRules For Me And Not For Thee\n\t\t\n\t\tA void-aimed complaint that wish to live in community that agrees with me\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tNo alt text\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tDefine \"Terrorist\"\n\t\t\n\t\tAlways question why your enemies are your enemies\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tNo alt text\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPosting \"Failures\" Can Be Good\n\t\t\n\t\tJust because something isn't the \"best\" at its job, doesn't mean it's without value.\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tFeatured Projects\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tA preview of the N-Body project\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tN-Body\n\t\t\n\t\tA simple yet robust particle simulation\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tNo alt text\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tStraddling Checkerboard\n\t\t\n\t\tA straddling checkerboard cipher of my own design\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tNo alt text\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tThe Apis Cipher\n\t\t\n\t\tA text cipher of my own creation.\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\tÂ©2022 |"
