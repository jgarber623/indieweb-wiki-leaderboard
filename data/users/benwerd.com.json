At the time, I was working on understanding what might be an interesting evolution of retirement plans.</em></p>\n<p>The 401(k) was created by accident as a result of tax reform in the late seventies. <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/01/04/a-brief-history-of-the-401k-which-changed-how-americans-retire.html\">Section 401(k) of the 1978 Revenue Act allowed employees to defer bonus or stock option compensation without incurring taxes.</a> An enterprising benefits consultant suggested that this could be a good way for companies to provide a retirement savings account — essentially a hack on top of the Revenue Act clause — and the rest is history. When the IRS declared that ongoing salary deductions could be put into these savings accounts a couple of years later, the race was on.</p>\n<p>By the mid eighties, over half of all the large firms in America offered a 401(k). Today, the 401(k) is simply how retirement plans are <em>done</em>.</p>\n<p>There was a simple reason for the change. Even though the returns for <em>employees</em> were less certain than a traditional pension plan, they were far cheaper and more predictable for <em>employers</em>. This was a double-edged sword: on one hand, employees didn’t have the security they had previously enjoyed. On the other, more employers could provide retirement plans at all.</p>\n<p>The net effect, however, is that employees are essentially bribed to take part in the stock market in the name of protecting their retirements.

                "value": "This is an edited version of a piece I wrote a few years ago elsewhere, which I’m now updating and publishing here. At the time, I was working on understanding what might be an interesting evolution of retirement plans.The 401(k) was created by accident as a result of tax reform in the late seventies. Section 401(k) of the 1978 Revenue Act allowed employees to defer bonus or stock option compensation without incurring taxes. An enterprising benefits consultant suggested that this could be a good way for companies to provide a retirement savings account — essentially a hack on top of the Revenue Act clause — and the rest is history. When the IRS declared that ongoing salary deductions could be put into these savings accounts a couple of years later, the race was on.By the mid eighties, over half of all the large firms in America offered a 401(k). Today, the 401(k) is simply how retirement plans are done.There was a simple reason for the change. Even though the returns for employees were less certain than a traditional pension plan, they were far cheaper and more predictable for employers. This was a double-edged sword: on one hand, employees didn’t have the security they had previously enjoyed. On the other, more employers could provide retirement plans at all.The net effect, however, is that employees are essentially bribed to take part in the stock market in the name of protecting their retirements. As we’ve seen, the dynamics of the stock market are not necessarily in their favor — and as it turns, out, most people saving for retirement don’t get to choose where their money goes.In practice, the 401(k) is a support plan for fossil fuels, arms companies, and all kinds of heinous shit.Clearly, retirement plans need regulation in order to protect the ordinary people who are trusting their futures to them.
