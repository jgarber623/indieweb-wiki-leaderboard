One thing that’s revealed to me is that there’s a whole generation of internet users whose entire model of how things work is based on the centralized, VC-funded service model.

It’s like the web itself: anyone can run a website using any hosting provider, and then anyone with a web browser can access it. But instead of being a collection of pages, it’s <em>conversations</em>. Anyone can have a conversation using any fediverse provider, and anyone with fediverse software can access it and take part.</p>\n<p>That also means there’s no business model; no ads; and no billionaire acquirer who can ruin it. It’s communally owned and maintained as a commons, like the web. (Technically it works using an open protocol called ActivityPub, but unless you’re a developer you don’t need to worry about that.)</p>\n<p>Lots of different software can access the fediverse.

You can converse with anyone on the fediverse using them, but each one has its own rules and policies about what you can post if you create a fediverse account using it. For example, <a href=\"https://newsie.social/\">newsie.social</a> is for people in journalism; <a href=\"https://mastodon.lol/\">mastodon.lol</a> describes itself as “a community friendly towards anti-fascists, members of the LGBTQ+ community, hackers, and the like.” You’re likely to be booted off if you have conversations that go against the ethos of the server.</p>\n<p>Anyone can install their own - either with their own technical server knowledge or using a hosting provider like <a href=\"https://masto.host/\">masto.host</a>. I maintain <a href=\"https://werd.social/\">werd.social</a> just for me. A lot of news organizations - and even the German government - run their own closed sites.
