[…] As a matter of fact, our leverage in the elections quite candidly goes up as the voting populace goes down.\"More recently, poll workers have left their positions after threats and harrasment. And the Brennan Center for Justice reports that “at least seven states enacted 10 laws that make voting more difficult — of these, 5 laws in five states are in place for the midterms. […] Since the beginning of 2021, lawmakers have passed at least 42 restrictive voting laws in 21 states.”.Meanwhile, the neoreactionary movement, which wants to replace American elected government with a CEO-like monarchy, has found deep pockets in billionaire former Facebook board-member Peter Thiel and at least two Senatorial candidates.For better or worse, America has an outsized influence on the world. Our votes help shape not just our communities, but communities everywhere. The representatives we pick shape our local culture and global economies; they can be the difference between war and peace, collaboration and colonization, poverty and living well. It’s not an idea to take lightly.Democracy is precious. Our voices matter. We’ve been given a Constitutional right, and we need to use it. As a citizen, you have the right to use it. Today is the day.If you need help, here’s how. Photo by Element5 Digital on Unsplash"

            "html": "<p>A while back I wrote a single-page site, <a href=\"https://getblogging.org/\">Get Blogging</a>, that’s designed to be a guide to which blogging platform to pick. It doesn’t actually tell you <em>how to blog</em> - and perhaps inevitably, I’ve started receiving lots of emails asking how to do just that.</p>\n<p>There isn’t really a one-size-fits-all answer to this question, but here’s how I’ve answered it in the past:</p>\n<p>A blog <em>post</em> is not the same as an essay or article. It’s simply an update to the log of information you’re writing on your website. That stream of posts, together, makes up your blog. So a post can be as short or as long as you like. It’s your voice, so they can also be as formal or informal as you like. I use a pretty informal voice in my blogging because that’s what comes naturally to me. You don’t need to do the same thing as me, or as anyone else.</p>\n<p>Some examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Simon Willison <a href=\"https://til.simonwillison.net/\">writes notes about things he’s learned</a> alongside <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/\">his regular blog</a>.

            "value": "A while back I wrote a single-page site, Get Blogging, that’s designed to be a guide to which blogging platform to pick. It doesn’t actually tell you how to blog - and perhaps inevitably, I’ve started receiving lots of emails asking how to do just that.There isn’t really a one-size-fits-all answer to this question, but here’s how I’ve answered it in the past:A blog post is not the same as an essay or article. It’s simply an update to the log of information you’re writing on your website. That stream of posts, together, makes up your blog. So a post can be as short or as long as you like. It’s your voice, so they can also be as formal or informal as you like. I use a pretty informal voice in my blogging because that’s what comes naturally to me.
