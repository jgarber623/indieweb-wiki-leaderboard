This isn’t to win points; it’s part of creating a more supportive environment for everyone, as opposed to one designed around the narrow demographic of people who have dominated mainstream business and culture at the expense of everyone else for generations.In the case of pronouns, the correct pronoun to use is not always obvious, and it’s always safer and more courteous to use self-reported pronouns than trying to guess. And it matters: in transgender youth in particular, acceptance of gender was correlated with one-third lower odds of a past-year suicide attempt. Giving people the space to declare theirs - and normalizing it across a community like a workplace or school - is a very low-effort way to protect the health and well-being of people who need it.More generally, I’m fed up of people who consider “woke” to be some kind of fad or societal affliction. It’s a welcome, progressive change that simply means you’re awake to the injustices of the past and want to correct them in the future. It’s worth considering what kind of person would find that to be a bad thing.For the record, my pronouns are he/him."

Mostly I do this because the Notion web clipper and iOS app makes life really easy for me.Then the bookmarks get synced in a few different ways:To my website using Micropub\nTo Buffer for scheduled sending to Twitter\nThe sync itself is via Zapier right now, but when I get time I’ll replace with my own script.I used to post directly to Twitter, but I realized that there’s no need to post there at the same time I save to my site. Because I tend to read my feeds in batches, Buffer helps me avoid posting floods of links to my Twitter account at once. It also gives me a little wiggle room if something goes wrong (eg if the sync accidentally triggers when I’m halfway through writing a description).At the end of the month, I take my links from the Notion database and use a simple script to turn them into a formatted post, which I edit in iA Writer before publishing to my site using its micropub feature.The end result:I have a searchable database of my bookmarks\nI reliably share them to my website\nI get to publish a round-up post at the end of the month, which is one of my favorite things\nIt sounds like a lot, but I really enjoy the process I’ve set up: it’s easy for me, and does everything I need it to."

And <a href=\"https://malwarwickonbooks.com/americans-read-books/\">only 59% of Americans read fiction books at all</a>.</p>\n<p>In contrast, over three quarters of you read more than ten fiction books a year; a sixth of you read more than fifty. This is fiction <em>only</em>: a subset of all the books you read. Although I didn’t connect this to demographic data or questions about what respondents read outside of fiction, I expect these stats hold up for the communities of most similar blogs.</p>\n<p><strong>No surprise: tech blog readers like science fiction. The world at large loves mystery and romance.</strong></p>\n<p>Everyone loves genre fiction - but <em>which</em> genres are sharply divergent.</p>\n<p>This community is far and away most interested in science fiction and speculative fiction (1 in 4), with fantasy coming in at a close second (almost 1 in 5). 10% of folks said they read literary and historical fiction each, followed by mystery (and “cozy mystery”, which is a distinct sub-category). 3% of the community reads romance novels.</p>\n<p>On the web as a whole, the numbers are very different. Almost 40% of respondents read mystery novels; 30% read romance; fantasy and horror are read by around a quarter of web visitors who filled in the survey. Only one in five web visitors read science fiction. Literary and historical fiction was in line with respondents from this community at 10% each.</p>\n<p><strong>Blog readers find their books offline.</strong></p>\n<p>About 20% of respondents from this community get their books through their local library - roughly the same percentage as the number who get them from Amazon. 15% get their books from traditional bookstores, and another 15% get them second hand.
