One thing that’s revealed to me is that there’s a whole generation of internet users whose entire model of how things work is based on the centralized, VC-funded service model.

It’s like the web itself: anyone can run a website using any hosting provider, and then anyone with a web browser can access it. But instead of being a collection of pages, it’s <em>conversations</em>. Anyone can have a conversation using any fediverse provider, and anyone with fediverse software can access it and take part.</p>\n<p>That also means there’s no business model; no ads; and no billionaire acquirer who can ruin it.

I always recommend using an authentication app. Authy is a good stand-alone app, but this functionality is also built into password managers like 1Password.Remove your credit card number.\nIf you’ve bought ads, remove your payment details from the system. We know that credit card numbers are stored insecurely on the platform.Remove sensitive DMs.\nDMs on Twitter are not encrypted. They could be leaked or mined by the company for other purposes.Use a password manager to generate your password.\nDon't try and use a password you've invented yourself. And don't share this password with any other system: it’s just for Twitter.Use a canary email address, if you can.\nAll Google-powered email addresses can have arbitrary labels added to them using a +. For example, the address ben+twitter@werd.io will still get to me - but if I use that label on my email address in my Twitter account, I'll know my account has been compromised when other entities start using it.Post via the web or using a third-party app.\nWe know that Twitter tracks very detailed location information from its app users. Web browsers keep you safe, so posting via the web does not carry the same risk."
