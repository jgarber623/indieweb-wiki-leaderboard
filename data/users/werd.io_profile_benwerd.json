The fediverse is growing much faster than any centralized social network, and you’re going to want to be involved.</p>\n<p>I’ve been trying to explain what the fediverse actually <em>is</em> in a few different contexts. One thing that’s revealed to me is that there’s a whole generation of internet users whose entire model of how things work is based on the centralized, VC-funded service model. For them, a service is tied to a domain name and run by a company, and that’s it - even though they likely use email every day. It’s a surprising (to me) way that the prevailing business models for the web have changed the conversation.</p>\n<p>So, here’s my attempt to explain it - and why you need to take part.</p>\n<p><strong>TLDR version</strong></p>\n<p>Everyone’s joining a new social network that is run as a commons instead of as a private company.

It’s like the web itself: anyone can run a website using any hosting provider, and then anyone with a web browser can access it. But instead of being a collection of pages, it’s <em>conversations</em>. Anyone can have a conversation using any fediverse provider, and anyone with fediverse software can access it and take part.</p>\n<p>That also means there’s no business model; no ads; and no billionaire acquirer who can ruin it. It’s communally owned and maintained as a commons, like the web. (Technically it works using an open protocol called ActivityPub, but unless you’re a developer you don’t need to worry about that.)</p>\n<p>Lots of different software can access the fediverse. The most popular right now is something called <a href=\"https://joinmastodon.org/\">Mastodon</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>How can I take part?</strong></p>\n<p>To be a part of the fediverse, you need to make an account and a profile on any fediverse-compatible service.</p>\n<p>Lots of people run <a href=\"https://joinmastodon.org/servers\">Mastodon instances</a>. You can converse with anyone on the fediverse using them, but each one has its own rules and policies about what you can post if you create a fediverse account using it. For example, <a href=\"https://newsie.social/\">newsie.social</a> is for people in journalism; <a href=\"https://mastodon.lol/\">mastodon.lol</a> describes itself as “a community friendly towards anti-fascists, members of the LGBTQ+ community, hackers, and the like.” You’re likely to be booted off if you have conversations that go against the ethos of the server.</p>\n<p>Anyone can install their own - either with their own technical server knowledge or using a hosting provider like <a href=\"https://masto.host/\">masto.host</a>. I maintain <a href=\"https://werd.social/\">werd.social</a> just for me. A lot of news organizations - and even the German government - run their own closed sites. When an account is hosted on a closed site for an organization, you can be sure that the user really is a member of that organization; it’s like verification on Twitter, back when verification meant something, but any organization can do it.</p>\n<p>It’s all free, but it’s always a good idea to contribute to the instance’s server costs if you can. After all, there aren’t any venture capitalists with deep pockets, people buying ads, or surveillance capitalism business models paying for it all.</p>\n<p><strong>How can I find my friends?</strong></p>\n<p>If you’re moving from Twitter, it’s a good idea to stick your fediverse username in your profile.

Then there are a few different tools that let you find your Twitter friends’ new Mastodon accounts:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://fedifinder.glitch.me/\">Fedifinder</a> will scrape your followed users, your followers, and your lists for fediverse handles, and then export them in a format that you can import straight into Mastodon. <a href=\"https://pruvisto.org/debirdify/\">Debirdify</a> also does the same thing. <a href=\"https://twitodon.com/\">Twitodon</a> needs both parties to actually be registered with Twitodon itself to work.</p>\n<p><strong>What about finding interesting conversations?</strong></p>\n<p>The fediverse doesn’t have universal search. At some point, this will probably change: this is one place where someone is likely to find an opening for a VC-funded service, for better or worse.

If you’re posting something that you think others might not want to read, you can wrap it in a CW. So when you search for conversations attached to a hashtag, you might see a lot of CWs.
