It’s simply an update to the log of information you’re writing on your website. That stream of posts, together, makes up your blog. So a post can be as short or as long as you like. It’s your voice, so they can also be as formal or informal as you like. I use a pretty informal voice in my blogging because that’s what comes naturally to me. You don’t need to do the same thing as me, or as anyone else.</p>\n<p>Some examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Simon Willison <a href=\"https://til.simonwillison.net/\">writes notes about things he’s learned</a> alongside <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/\">his regular blog</a>.

Until then, think of it like starting a running habit. The first few days you run, it’s awful and you think it’ll never feel any better.

Those comments are important: blogs are a community spread across thousands of sites, and it’s a good idea to join in and add value where you can. Don’t comment to self-promote; comment to share and uplift.</p>\n<p>And then how do you gain an audience? First: don’t think of it as an audience. It’s a <em>community</em>, and you’re joining it, not gaining it.</p>\n<p>There are plenty of sites out there that purport to tell you how to get 100,000 readers and a bunch of money really quickly. They’re all grifters, trying to (you’ve guessed it) gain a ton of readers and a bunch of money really quickly.
