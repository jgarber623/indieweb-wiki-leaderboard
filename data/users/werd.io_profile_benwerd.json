            "html": "<p><img src=\"https://werd.io/file/634de5bd46e24340ef7010d2/thumb.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\"></p>\n<p>Last week, <a href=\"https://werd.io/2022/how-do-you-read-fiction\">I asked you about your fiction-reading habits</a> as part of my research for a personal project I’m working on.</p>\n<p>I also ran a separate survey on Google Surveys - getting in just <a href=\"https://support.google.com/surveys/answer/12626240\">before that service shuts down next month</a> - to get a sense of what the average web visitor reads.</p>\n<p>Although I expected this community to diverge from overall web visitors in key ways, I was surprised - but perhaps shouldn’t have been - by where it <em>didn’t</em>.</p>\n<p>Here’s the biggest headline: traditional, paper books are still by far the best way for an author to reach even a technical audience. Most people across all audiences discover books via traditional bookstores, word of mouth, and the library - so if you’re limiting yourself to self-published ebooks, you’re missing out in a big way. More on that in a moment.</p>\n<p><strong>Blog readers like to read fiction far more than the average person.</strong></p>\n<p>First, some overall numbers:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/388541/americans-reading-fewer-books-past.aspx\">The average American reads twelve <em>books</em> a year</a>: a number that includes non-fiction titles. And <a href=\"https://malwarwickonbooks.com/americans-read-books/\">only 59% of Americans read fiction books at all</a>.</p>\n<p>In contrast, over three quarters of you read more than ten fiction books a year; a sixth of you read more than fifty. This is fiction <em>only</em>: a subset of all the books you read. Although I didn’t connect this to demographic data or questions about what respondents read outside of fiction, I expect these stats hold up for the communities of most similar blogs.</p>\n<p><strong>No surprise: tech blog readers like science fiction. The world at large loves mystery and romance.</strong></p>\n<p>Everyone loves genre fiction - but <em>which</em> genres are sharply divergent.</p>\n<p>This community is far and away most interested in science fiction and speculative fiction (1 in 4), with fantasy coming in at a close second (almost 1 in 5). 10% of folks said they read literary and historical fiction each, followed by mystery (and “cozy mystery”, which is a distinct sub-category). 3% of the community reads romance novels.</p>\n<p>On the web as a whole, the numbers are very different. Almost 40% of respondents read mystery novels; 30% read romance; fantasy and horror are read by around a quarter of web visitors who filled in the survey. Only one in five web visitors read science fiction. Literary and historical fiction was in line with respondents from this community at 10% each.</p>\n<p><strong>Blog readers find their books offline.</strong></p>\n<p>About 20% of respondents from this community get their books through their local library - roughly the same percentage as the number who get them from Amazon. 15% get their books from traditional bookstores, and another 15% get them second hand. Other sources (including other stores, like Apple Books) came in at very small percentages.</p>\n<p>A much higher percentage of the wider web gets their books via Amazon - around 40%. Only 10% of them get their books from a bookstore.</p>\n<p>These latter statistics are closer to what I expected to see across the board, but blog readers are far more likely to go to independent bookstores, visit their local library, and borrow books from friends and family. So while this community is more technically-inclined, its book consumption is actually <em>more offline</em> than the general public.</p>\n<p><strong>We find our books through word of mouth.</strong></p>\n<p>Almost 40% of readers in this community preferred to learn about books through friends and family. Booktok doesn’t reach us: only 1% saw recommendations via TikTok.

            "value": "Last week, I asked you about your fiction-reading habits as part of my research for a personal project I’m working on.I also ran a separate survey on Google Surveys - getting in just before that service shuts down next month - to get a sense of what the average web visitor reads.Although I expected this community to diverge from overall web visitors in key ways, I was surprised - but perhaps shouldn’t have been - by where it didn’t.Here’s the biggest headline: traditional, paper books are still by far the best way for an author to reach even a technical audience. Most people across all audiences discover books via traditional bookstores, word of mouth, and the library - so if you’re limiting yourself to self-published ebooks, you’re missing out in a big way. More on that in a moment.Blog readers like to read fiction far more than the average person.First, some overall numbers:The average American reads twelve books a year: a number that includes non-fiction titles. And only 59% of Americans read fiction books at all.In contrast, over three quarters of you read more than ten fiction books a year; a sixth of you read more than fifty. This is fiction only: a subset of all the books you read. Although I didn’t connect this to demographic data or questions about what respondents read outside of fiction, I expect these stats hold up for the communities of most similar blogs.No surprise: tech blog readers like science fiction. The world at large loves mystery and romance.Everyone loves genre fiction - but which genres are sharply divergent.This community is far and away most interested in science fiction and speculative fiction (1 in 4), with fantasy coming in at a close second (almost 1 in 5). 10% of folks said they read literary and historical fiction each, followed by mystery (and “cozy mystery”, which is a distinct sub-category). 3% of the community reads romance novels.On the web as a whole, the numbers are very different. Almost 40% of respondents read mystery novels; 30% read romance; fantasy and horror are read by around a quarter of web visitors who filled in the survey. Only one in five web visitors read science fiction. Literary and historical fiction was in line with respondents from this community at 10% each.Blog readers find their books offline.About 20% of respondents from this community get their books through their local library - roughly the same percentage as the number who get them from Amazon. 15% get their books from traditional bookstores, and another 15% get them second hand. Other sources (including other stores, like Apple Books) came in at very small percentages.A much higher percentage of the wider web gets their books via Amazon - around 40%. Only 10% of them get their books from a bookstore.These latter statistics are closer to what I expected to see across the board, but blog readers are far more likely to go to independent bookstores, visit their local library, and borrow books from friends and family. So while this community is more technically-inclined, its book consumption is actually more offline than the general public.We find our books through word of mouth.Almost 40% of readers in this community preferred to learn about books through friends and family. Booktok doesn’t reach us: only 1% saw recommendations via TikTok. Social media, on the other hand, represented 25% (even if only 5% followed up on recommendations from blogs). 12% of respondents learned about books via Goodreads.In both sets, around 12% got their recommendations from displays in physical bookstores. But whereas only 4% of this community said they learned through Amazon recommendations, 25% of general website visitors listed it as a main source. Only 6% of general website visitors learned about books from Goodreads.Paper books still rule.Finally, across both datasets, paper books rule supreme: 60% for the general public and for blog readers alike.In both cases, about 20% read their books specifically on Amazon’s Kindle platform. About 10% “read” via an audiobook platform (mostly Audible, which is also owned by Amazon). And even among my open source forward community, only around 1% read using alternative ebook platforms.I was genuinely surprised by this: I thought I’d see much higher ebook usage in my blog community.

            "value": "JP Morgan cancelled Kanye West’s bank accounts following his anti-semitic remarks today.Over the last few years, a raft of “free speech” social networks have emerged as an alternative to the content policies enacted by companies like Twitter. They take very public anti “cancel culture” stances. But what does that really mean?Using observer accounts, I took a peek at each of the main ones to see how this particular piece of news went down. Here I will issue a content warning: posts on these sites, including those run by mainstream political operators, are extremely disturbing. Truth Social is owned by the Trump Media and Technology Group, which in turn is chaired by former President Donald Trump. There, an account with over 50,000 followers (10% of its Daily Active Users) states: Kanye is being called out by the ADL for questioning jewish power. If you haven't noticed you're not supposed to point out that Hollywood, banks, and many other things are dominated by a cabal of satanic jews. Truth Social has around 2 million users. Gab was founded in 2016 as the first right-wing alternative social network. The founder (who has 3.7 million followers) writes: Kanye criticizes Jewish people and instantly gets banned from all social media platforms and banks. Funny how that keeps happening to people who do so. In response to a post that asks \"who runs JP Morgan Chase?\" hundreds of users respond with some variation of \"the Jews\".Gab has around 4 million users. Minds was founded in 2011 and originally built on top of Elgg, the open source social networking framework I co-founded. While it was originally created as an alternative to surveillance capitalism, its anti-banning stance caused it to provide a home to white supremacists banned from mainstream networks in the wake of the January 6 insurrection. (Indeed, Trump had invited its founders to the White House alongside the founders of the networks listed above in 2019.)Over there, a popular post states: Jews in our government need to be pulled out by the root like weeds-there are reasons Hitlers first move as chancellor was to remove all Jews from parliament-he knew what they were and still are today-Communists! Minds has over two million users. GETTR is another conservative Twitter clone, this time founded by a former Trump aide. Here the anti-semitism is less overt, although a few comments from fringe accounts did talk about “the satanic Jews”, which was a trope on the other networks.GETTR also has around 4 million users. Parler, which also emerged during the Trump era, is hopelessly unusable.

Season twelve in particular was a lot of fun, and I enjoyed <a href=\"https://www.syfy.com/syfy-wire/doctor-who-season-12-finale-timeless-children-regeneration-canon\">the mystery that The Timeless Children brought back to the character’s origins</a>. The execution could sometimes have been tighter, but it was all good. I’ll follow this show anywhere.</p>\n<p>What I wish, though, is that they’d embrace some smaller stories. Classic <em>Who</em> was often structured like a mystery novel: something weird was happening, and the Doctor would have to get to the bottom of what was causing it. Often there were multiple contenders, like potential murderers in an Agatha Christie or Sherlock Holmes story. The survival of the world didn’t need to be at stake; it could be creepy and self-contained in its own right. The stories could still talk about big topics, but they didn’t need to be bombastic to be effective.</p>\n<p>That’s true across a lot of modern reboots. The myriad <em>Star Treks</em>, for example, seem to feel the need to be action-packed movies instead of the idea-led potboilers of the past. I think producers think they need to do this to get past our shorter attention spans, but they’re missing the point: our quality filters are higher than they ever were, and the way to keep our attention is to give us tightly-written, compellingly-acted, humanistically-directed drama.

            "value": "I’ll follow Doctor Who anywhere - I’ve been a fan since I was five years old - but the trailer for the BBC Centennial episode left me cold, even despite the welcomed presence of Ace and Tegan.It’s had some criticism, and there were some clunkers (hello, Kerblam), but I’ve broadly enjoyed this era: an optimistic Doctor, a renewed focus on inclusion and kindness, a family-friendliness that doubtless brought in new kids. Season twelve in particular was a lot of fun, and I enjoyed the mystery that The Timeless Children brought back to the character’s origins. The execution could sometimes have been tighter, but it was all good. I’ll follow this show anywhere.What I wish, though, is that they’d embrace some smaller stories. Classic Who was often structured like a mystery novel: something weird was happening, and the Doctor would have to get to the bottom of what was causing it. Often there were multiple contenders, like potential murderers in an Agatha Christie or Sherlock Holmes story. The survival of the world didn’t need to be at stake; it could be creepy and self-contained in its own right. The stories could still talk about big topics, but they didn’t need to be bombastic to be effective.That’s true across a lot of modern reboots. The myriad Star Treks, for example, seem to feel the need to be action-packed movies instead of the idea-led potboilers of the past. I think producers think they need to do this to get past our shorter attention spans, but they’re missing the point: our quality filters are higher than they ever were, and the way to keep our attention is to give us tightly-written, compellingly-acted, humanistically-directed drama. Some of the best modern television - Succession, Severance, Slow Horses - do understand this, but clearly not everyone got the memo.I’ll absolutely watch, probably multiple times, and I’ll probably love it. But I do wish we’d swap flash back for substance. Maybe I’m just getting old."
