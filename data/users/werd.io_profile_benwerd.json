One thing that’s revealed to me is that there’s a whole generation of internet users whose entire model of how things work is based on the centralized, VC-funded service model. For them, a service is tied to a domain name and run by a company, and that’s it - even though they likely use email every day.

It’s like the web itself: anyone can run a website using any hosting provider, and then anyone with a web browser can access it. But instead of being a collection of pages, it’s <em>conversations</em>. Anyone can have a conversation using any fediverse provider, and anyone with fediverse software can access it and take part.</p>\n<p>That also means there’s no business model; no ads; and no billionaire acquirer who can ruin it. It’s communally owned and maintained as a commons, like the web. (Technically it works using an open protocol called ActivityPub, but unless you’re a developer you don’t need to worry about that.)</p>\n<p>Lots of different software can access the fediverse. The most popular right now is something called <a href=\"https://joinmastodon.org/\">Mastodon</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>How can I take part?</strong></p>\n<p>To be a part of the fediverse, you need to make an account and a profile on any fediverse-compatible service.</p>\n<p>Lots of people run <a href=\"https://joinmastodon.org/servers\">Mastodon instances</a>. You can converse with anyone on the fediverse using them, but each one has its own rules and policies about what you can post if you create a fediverse account using it. For example, <a href=\"https://newsie.social/\">newsie.social</a> is for people in journalism; <a href=\"https://mastodon.lol/\">mastodon.lol</a> describes itself as “a community friendly towards anti-fascists, members of the LGBTQ+ community, hackers, and the like.” You’re likely to be booted off if you have conversations that go against the ethos of the server.</p>\n<p>Anyone can install their own - either with their own technical server knowledge or using a hosting provider like <a href=\"https://masto.host/\">masto.host</a>. I maintain <a href=\"https://werd.social/\">werd.social</a> just for me. A lot of news organizations - and even the German government - run their own closed sites.

All eyes are on us.</p>\n<p>There’s a lot of propaganda out there asking us <em>not</em> to vote. “It doesn’t make a difference,” they’ll say. Or: “the lines are really long.” Or they’ll talk down the whole process, as if democracy isn’t cool, or participating in it is some kind of affront to a higher cause. Or they’ll suggest - <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/issues/ensure-every-american-can-vote/vote-suppression/myth-voter-fraud\">wrongly and maliciously</a> - that the whole thing is rigged.</p>\n<p>Bullshit. Vote. This is the bare minimum table stakes for living in a democracy. Picking our elected representatives matters. Voting on ballot initiatives matters. This is the way we get to have a say.</p>\n<p>There are a lot of politicians who think not every eligible citizen <em>should</em> vote. Paul Weyrich, a conservative political activist, memorably said in a speech:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\"I don't want everybody to vote. […] As a matter of fact, our leverage in the elections quite candidly goes up as the voting populace goes down.\"</p></blockquote>\n<p>More recently, <a href=\"https://19thnews.org/2022/07/arizona-election-official-leslie-hoffman/\">poll workers have left their positions after threats and harrasment</a>.

            "value": "Alright, America. All eyes are on us.There’s a lot of propaganda out there asking us not to vote. “It doesn’t make a difference,” they’ll say. Or: “the lines are really long.” Or they’ll talk down the whole process, as if democracy isn’t cool, or participating in it is some kind of affront to a higher cause. Or they’ll suggest - wrongly and maliciously - that the whole thing is rigged.Bullshit. Vote. This is the bare minimum table stakes for living in a democracy. Picking our elected representatives matters. Voting on ballot initiatives matters. This is the way we get to have a say.There are a lot of politicians who think not every eligible citizen should vote.
