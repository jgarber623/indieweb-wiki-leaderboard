This \"the\" is not the article of any noun, itis a different word, a conjunction descended from the old English \"pa\", pronounced \"tha\" which means either \"when\" or \"then\". Back in early Middle English the structure \"if - then\" had not taken over and if you wanted to express an if - then relationship you said \"pa whatever, pa whatever\", meaning \"when such-and- such, then such-and-such\". \"pa\" sounds almost the same as \"the\" and the spelling of the two converged, but the meaning remained totally different. \"the more, the merrier\" literally means \"when more, then merrier\" or \"if more, then merrier'; same as centuries ago.\n\ne RE: TN 5] 5"
