I've been writing code and making games and building computers and setting up websites and all those sorts of things since I was a child — and I find doing all those things <em>fun</em>.\nFor me I've set up microblog.pub as a single person activitypub/fediverse/mastodon instance because then I can <em>play</em> with it. I spend hours tweaking my css to make the site look how I want. I contribute patches and discussions to the help build, improve, and add features to the microblog.pub software that I use. All of that is a source of joy for me.\nBut that's me.</p>\n<p>Most people don't have my technical privilege. Most people just want a social media platform that will do the job of connecting them to their networks and showing them the content they're looking for.</p>\n<p>And I can yell and shout about how <a class=\"mention hashtag\" href=\"https://acegiak.net/t/indieweb\" rel=\"tag\">#<span>indieweb</span></a> or fedi/masto/AP is better than platforms for this that or the other reason. And I do genuinely believe in those open platforms for those reasons. But those reasons aren't why I love them.

                "value": "Ok let's be honest.\nI like the fediverse because it caters to me. I have huge technical privilege. I've been writing code and making games and building computers and setting up websites and all those sorts of things since I was a child — and I find doing all those things fun.\nFor me I've set up microblog.pub as a single person activitypub/fediverse/mastodon instance because then I can play with it. I spend hours tweaking my css to make the site look how I want. I contribute patches and discussions to the help build, improve, and add features to the microblog.pub software that I use.
