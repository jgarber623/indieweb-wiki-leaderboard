I even made my own browser at some point, but I recently basically decided to give up on it and go back to Firefox.\n\n@eaplmx The number one (#1) problem with Government(s) (all? most?) is there is never any consequences to their action(s). So much corruption and illegal activities that would normally carry consequences of years of jail time, fines that would send you broke, don’t seem to apply to Government(s) or Politicians.\nIf they did, they wouldn’t do half the stupid corrupt shit they get away with in the first place and actually serve the goddamn people they’re meant to serve.\nThat’s my opinion and something I believe (hope) we can one-day fix 🤞"
