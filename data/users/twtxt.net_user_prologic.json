Made a paper template with the hole pattern for the stainless steel screws. My hope is that this tooth pattern helps bringing the mash into the middle of the drum. With a crude punch out of a nail pushed into a branch I transferred the locations onto the wheel and drilled the holes on the drillpress at an angle. Parts for the inner box are glued together. The frame where the inner box will sit in and the handcrank will be built tomorrow. Let's see how that goes.\n\nDid you have a plan for this build or mostly just winging it? 🤔"
