That's what has been happening with Mastodon. I think we can do better.\n\n@abucci In real terms though won’t that just be a rogue network of pods distinct and different but running the same (or modified) software? 🤔 This is a hard problem to solve, because it a “human problem”. My view has always been that, if you believe in that kind of stuff, and like to be with other abusive groups of people, fine. But be on your own, and in the open. In other words, do we care? We would just not peer with pods like that or follow feeds from such folks? Right? 🤔 Being a decentralised network the power is in your hands, however the original Yarn is really about how we deal with abuse on our pods…\nHmmm 🤔 I really do feel like we’ve opened a can of worms here 😅"
