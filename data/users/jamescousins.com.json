I am grateful prose has been used ever since.<br>\nBut it was for Tony Belton, now in his 52nd year on the council (and author of an excellent <a href=\"https://tonybelton.wordpress.com/\">local newsletter</a>) to really bring politics to the meeting. Returning to my first-ever council meeting, Belton was leader of the opposition, and his speech of thanks to the Mayor was undoubtedly political. Many felt it inappropriate. But, I was told, he felt that for much of the audience it might be the only five minutes of local politics they get in the year: it was the price of entry for the free food and drink they would enjoy afterwards.<br>\nAnd he was as right then as he was on Wednesday. Nominating Hogg as the new council leader, he discussed not just his personal merits, but the huge challenges he faces. With multiple crises, from climate to cost-of-living, or housing to inequality, it is little use pretending the Labour administration is inheriting a perfect borough or situation.<br>\nWhat was interesting, though, was the atmosphere afterwards. I won’t pretend it was like the 1997 election or the 2009 presidential inauguration were for many, but it had a tinge of those days. There were feelings of hope and optimism in the air.<br>\nChatting with some council officers afterwards, it was obvious the new administration had come in with a clear programme and hitting the ground running. After 44 years of running Wandsworth with methods developed in the early 80s (much as some of us tried and failed to change that), things will be different.<br>\nThe test is how those changes impact on the borough over the next four years.

The table below uses data the excellent <a href=\"https://data.london.gov.uk/\">London Datastore</a> to see if there was any discernible pattern.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Short story. I still haven’t found one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to look for yourself the table below is sortable (there’s a little black sort button on each column about half-way up on the right-hand side of each header). You can sort by multiple columns by holding ‘shift’ as you click. The size of the table does make it a bit unwieldy on phones, sorry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have tried to explore a few different explanations. The first is the good old Inner/Outer London split. You are a bit more likely to be in an open borough if you are inner London.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I looked at population density and school age children to see if this could offer any explanation. This might be the most logical reason for openings that looks odd, since the boroughs vary enormously in size, which might result in decisions that there odd at first sight, but made sense when looking at the numbers. Again, I couldn’t see any pattern here. I did explore by trying to look at the number of schools and how that might affect things. Again, this produced no obvious answers, although that might be skewed by things like cross-border and private schools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also wondered about educational need. Given the government’s repeated statements of the importance of keeping children in education it’s possible factors related to educational need might have relevance. I used English proficiency or children looked after as imperfect proxies for these but, once again, there was no obvious link.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other possibility is that the government have been looking at trends, but given their inability to spot and act on nationally rising rates during the last national lockdown I suspect it’s unlikely they can do this on a borough level.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have tried various combinations of factors and other data, but not managed to come up with anything. It is possible, of course, that the Department for Education is using a weighted combination that I’ve not come close to. I like to think that there is some logic to it. But unless and until the criteria used are published it’s very easy to conclude the reasoning behind the decisions is not entirely based in controlling the virus.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure

                "value": "So am I. I couldn’t help thinking that there must be some logic I’m missing. So pulled together more data. The table below uses data the excellent London Datastore to see if there was any discernible pattern.\n\n\n\nShort story. I still haven’t found one.\n\n\n\nIf you want to look for yourself the table below is sortable (there’s a little black sort button on each column about half-way up on the right-hand side of each header). You can sort by multiple columns by holding ‘shift’ as you click. The size of the table does make it a bit unwieldy on phones, sorry.\n\n\n\nI have tried to explore a few different explanations. The first is the good old Inner/Outer London split. You are a bit more likely to be in an open borough if you are inner London.\n\n\n\nI looked at population density and school age children to see if this could offer any explanation. This might be the most logical reason for openings that looks odd, since the boroughs vary enormously in size, which might result in decisions that there odd at first sight, but made sense when looking at the numbers. Again, I couldn’t see any pattern here. I did explore by trying to look at the number of schools and how that might affect things. Again, this produced no obvious answers, although that might be skewed by things like cross-border and private schools.\n\n\n\nI also wondered about educational need. Given the government’s repeated statements of the importance of keeping children in education it’s possible factors related to educational need might have relevance. I used English proficiency or children looked after as imperfect proxies for these but, once again, there was no obvious link.\n\n\n\nThe other possibility is that the government have been looking at trends, but given their inability to spot and act on nationally rising rates during the last national lockdown I suspect it’s unlikely they can do this on a borough level.\n\n\n\nI have tried various combinations of factors and other data, but not managed to come up with anything. It is possible, of course, that the Department for Education is using a weighted combination that I’ve not come close to. I like to think that there is some logic to it. But unless and until the criteria used are published it’s very easy to conclude the reasoning behind the decisions is not entirely based in controlling the virus.\n\n\n\nBoroughStatusInner/Outer LondonCase rateControlPrimary schoolsPopulation density (per hectare) 2017Proportion of population aged 0-15, 2015% of pupils whose first language is not English (2015)Rates of Children Looked After (2016)GLA Population Estimate 2017BarnetClosedOuter730Con9144.921.146.035389,600CroydonClosedOuter780Lab8644.72236.786386,500EalingClosedOuter623Lab6863.321.443.646351,600EnfieldClosedOuter949Lab6841.222.855.343333,000BrentClosedOuter632Lab6076.820.937.645332,100BromleyClosedOuter825Con7721.819.938.940327,900RedbridgeClosedOuter1,027Lab5253.922.866.528304,200HillingdonClosedOuter743Con6926.021.329.649301,000GreenwichOpenOuter705Lab6359.221.944.178280,100Waltham ForestClosedOuter857Lab5171.221.862.443276,200HounslowClosedOuter708Lab5349.021.150.645274,200HaveringClosedOuter1,095Con (council NOC)6122.619.338.942254,300HarrowOpenOuter726Lab4250.020.557.632252,300BexleyClosedOuter1,006Con5740.320.632.646244,300Barking and DagenhamClosedOuter950Lab4457.927.241.769209,000MertonClosedOuter776Lab4455.320.634.235208,100SuttonClosedOuter747LD4046.220.734.350202,600Richmond upon ThamesClosedOuter593LD4534.420.753.526197,300Kingston upon ThamesOpenOuter595LD3647.119.639.330175,400NewhamClosedInner894Lab6694.722.758.842342,900LambethOpenInner696Lab60122.717.639.173328,900WandsworthClosedInner685Con6193.717.850.841321,000SouthwarkClosedInner673Lab74108.918.629.875314,300Tower HamletsClosedInner917Lab70153.720.151.147304,000LewishamOpenInner696Lab6386.320.640.969303,400HaringeyOpenInner785Lab6493.92048.067278,000HackneyOpenInner751Lab58144.020.744.253274,300CamdenOpenInner481Lab42111.317.325.241242,500WestminsterClosedInner476Con40112.715.952.639242,100IslingtonOpenInner593Lab46155.615.957.688231,200Hammersmith and FulhamClosedInner587Lab37113.017.448.958185,300Kensington and ChelseaClosedInner476Con27131.116.445.837159,000Data: London Datastore"
