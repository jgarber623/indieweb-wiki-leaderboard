            "html": "<p>Before you get angry at me for this title, please let me state that I count\nmyself in the number of the “idiots” and, secondly, that what I mean by\n“idiotism” here is not to be intended as an offence, but as some traits of\nmindset which are typical of very logical brains.</p>\n<p>Some months ago I finished reading Dostoevskiy's “The Idiot”, a book about an\nexceedingly good-hearted man, prince Lev Mishkin, whose behaviour was puzzling\nthe people around him so much that they thought of him as an idiot. Sure, the\nfact that he was suffering from epilepsy didn't help, but it was far from being\nthe primary reason for their thinking, since his epileptic seizures were very\nrare (if I remember correctly, only two occurred during the time of the story)\nand everybody's opinion had already formed well ahead of witnessing him in such\na state.</p>\n<p>He was an idiot because he was open, trustful, and especially because he could\nnot “read between the lines” of what was been said to him: his social conduct\nwas straight, and although he was following at his best the customs that he had\nbeen taught, he was supposedly awkward and unable to perceive and parse all the\nmessages that are implicitly conveyed by social behaviours and human\ninteractions. I added the word “supposedly” because, as a matter of fact, his\nbehaviours were all perfectly normal for me: I only noticed their awkwardness\nwhen it was pointed out by the other characters, at which point I couldn't help\nsmiling and acknowledging that, indeed, that thing he did was weird.</p>\n<p>However, he was a good and caring person, and not without talents: he had an\ninterest in calligraphy, and everybody liked to listen to him, as his speech\nwas insightful and his thoughts were original. I wonder how many of my readers\ncan identify themselves in such a character?</p>\n<p>I definitely can. I won't get into the details, but I've felt many times on me\nthe amused or puzzled glance of people (like that time in high school when I\ncould not open a door in front of dozens of people, and I heard them say “So,\nthat guy is the genius of mathematics?” — I'll never forget that!), often\nwithout understanding the reason for their reactions. Still, generally people\nseem to like my company and be genuinely interested in talking to me.</p>\n<p>So, what's wrong with prince Lev Mishkin, me, and maybe with you too? Well, a few\nthings, I would say. I'm not going to claim any scientific truth on what I'm\ngoing to say, these are just my own impressions and deductions, which seem\nto be shared by other people in the interwebs too, judging from a quick search\nI did; take them for what they are.</p>\n<p>The first thing I notice is some common traits between us and autistic people:\nwe tend to work better with things, rather than with people; we can to focus on\na certain thing (work, a mathematical problem, a game) and forget about the\nworld around us; we have our unique hobbies, like solving puzzles, arguing\nabout a specific and very narrow topic, learning artificial (both human and\nprogramming) languages; it's as if we needed to build a small, better world\nwhere we would feel safe and at ease.</p>\n<p>The other thing, which I actually consider harmful and which I put efforts to\nchange in my own life, is the fact that it's extremely easy to get us\ninterested into a specific aspect of a problem, and make us forget (or just not\nnotice) the big picture. That small part that we are looking at is stimulating\nand challenging, and we are led to think that it's core of the issue, and maybe\nof all the issues that affect our world. What is often missing is the ability\nto take one step back and try to look at the issue from a different angle, and\nespecially the ability to listen for counter arguments; I mean, we do listen to\nthem, but since we have, in a way, “gamified” the issue, even when we think\nthat we are open to listen for the other side, we are in reality trying to win\nthe counter-arguments, rather than genuinely trying to understanding them.</p>\n<p>Another thing which we have, is faith. Yes, you read it right: even though the\nIT world is probably the one with the highest percentage of atheists, men\nalways need something to believe in. We just don't realize it, but we do hold a\nblind trust in certain persons and authorities. This does not mean that this\ntrust lives forever and cannot be broken, but this generally does not occur\nbecause of a conscious realization of ours. Much more often than we'd like to\nadmit, the reason why we lose faith in a certain person or authority is because\n<em>the rest of the persons and authorities that we trust has told us so</em>. In\nother words, even if there's undoubtedly a reasoning of our own, the full\nrealisation and conviction occurs after having collected and compared the\nopinions (or statements) of those we trust. The net result is that the IT\npopulation is the one most trustful of the mainstream media, because it's the\nmainstream media who has more “voice”: that's where the most <em>reputable</em>\njournalists, scientists, activists are (and “reputable” is the key word here,\nsince this reputation is recursively created by the mainstream media\nthemselves or by their sponsors).</p>\n<p>I might be biased by my own experience here, but it seems to me that there\nisn't a group of people more homogenous in their political (and generally,\nworld) views than that of IT workers. When, in 2018, I saw the leaked video of\nGoogle's co-founder Sergei Brin and other executives' reaction at Trump's\npresidential victory, what I found most surprising was not the contents of the\nspeech, as they were mostly mainstream opinions, but rather the fact that all\nthis could be said in a company meeting. Something like this, I though, could\nnever happen in an European company, as political matters are a conventional\ntabu in the work environment. But the point is that Brin and others could say\nthose words only because <em>they knew</em> that the overwhelming majority of the\naudience shared the same opinion. I don't think you could find the same\nhomogeneity of thought among shop assistants or philosophy professors.</p>\n<p>Assuming that you have followed me this far into my rambling, and that you\nrecognize that there might be some truth in what I wrote, you might now be\nwondering if there's a way to counterbalance our “idiotic” traits.\nUnfortunately I don't have a full answer, as myself am only halfway there (but\nmaybe I'm too optimistic here? and does this road even ever end?), but there\nare a few things that I think are absolutely worth trying:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Talk with people. Better if face to face, or at least in a video call; just\n  1-on-1, avoid groups, or you'll get on the defensive and try to defend your\n  position for the sake of not losing the argument in front of an audience. But\n  it's not a fight. Your goal when talking should not be that of convincing or\n  getting convinced, but rather just to <em>understand</em> the other points of view.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Read both sides of the narrative. Try to see the other party's argument as\n  they themselves present it, and not how it is presented in the media you\n  usually read. Media often use this trick, to either invite “clown\n  representatives” of the other point of view just to ridicule it, or they give them\n  too little time, or extrapolate their answer out of context, just to make\n  them appear unsensible.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Always assume that other people are smart, and that no one is bad.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Whatever the argument, try to answer the key question: “Cui bono?” (who\n  profits?) to be at least aware of all the hidden interests behind this and\n  that. They don't necessarily invalidate a position, but they must be\n  considered.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Lose faith. The only faith you are allowed to keep is the faith in God (or\n  Gods), if you have it: but men, theories, institutions, authorities\n  (including religious ones!), these must always be assumed to be imperfect and\n  not blindly trusted.  People serve their interests or can be manipulated. Try\n  always to start from a clean table and an empty mind, and see if they have\n  enough arguments to convince you. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Do never assume “They can not <em>all</em> be wrong” or “If this were wrong, at\n  least some media would report it”. It just doesn't work this way, this is\n  again a matter of having faith in the majority. Think of how many times in\n  (recent) history you were presented an unambiguous truth, which later came\n  out to be a scam (Iraq war being a famous one).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Defocus. You might be spending a lot of energy into something that's not\n  worth it. I mean, feel free to pursue whatever hobbies you like, as long as\n  they make you feel better. But if you think you have a <em>mission</em>, think twice\n  about it. Think about the world you'd like to live in, and whether/how this\n  mission contributes to it.<sup id=\"fnref:saudi\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"http://www.mardy.it/blog/2022/11/the-idiotism-of-software-developers.html#fn:saudi\">2</a></sup></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Ask questions.

We used Deride to generate the mocked\nimplementation and a <code>MockHorse</code> class which can be used to control the mocked\nobjects. When building the test, we won't link against the original\n<code>horse.cpp</code>, but we'll only use the original <code>horse.h</code>; the implementation will\nbe found in <code>mock_horse.cpp</code>, generated by Deride. And in the corresponding\n<code>mock_horse.h</code> file we'll find the <code>MockHorse</code> class with all the\n<code>on&lt;method&gt;Called()</code> hooks which we can use to install our callbacks

            "value": "If you have been writing C++ classes for mocking out your C or C++\ndependencies, you know how tedious it is. I generally write small classes with\njust a handful of methods, so it's generally bearable, but when using\nthird-party code I'm usually not that lucky. If the dependency is a C library\nthis becomes especially tricky, both because they might be larger than what you\ncan handle, and both because the lack of an object-oriented design might not\noffer you an easy solution to store the mock object data.\nBut fear no more, Deride is here!\nI won't spend too many words describing it, since you can read its description\nfrom the link above, where you will also find some example code. More examples,\nby the way, can be found in the example/ folder in the code\nrepository, where you can see how it can be\nused to mock both pure C++ and QObject-based classes, and C libraries.\nWhat is most important for me to say now, is that the project is in alpha\nstate, meaning that I've tried it on a handful of header files only; it's\nhighly likely that it will not work on many real-life scenarios, and if that\nhappens I warmly invite you to inform me by filing a bug\nreport providing the include file\nthat was not properly processed.\nI leave you with a short example of a unit test, written using Deride. The\nclass under test is called Stable, and internally it uses objects of type\nHorse, that we decided to mock. We used Deride to generate the mocked\nimplementation and a MockHorse class which can be used to control the mocked\nobjects. When building the test, we won't link against the original\nhorse.cpp, but we'll only use the original horse.h; the implementation will\nbe found in mock_horse.cpp, generated by Deride. And in the corresponding\nmock_horse.h file we'll find the MockHorse class with all the\non<method>Called() hooks which we can use to install our callbacks (either to\nreimplement the object behaviour, or to just be notified on when its methods\nare called).\n    /* This MockHorse is the object created by Deride\n     *                   |\n     *                   |\n     *                  \\|/\n     *                   V\n     */\n    using Mock = Animals::MockHorse;\n\n    std::list<std::string> horseNames = {\n        \"Tom\",\n        \"Dick\",\n        \"Harry\",\n    };\n\n    /* We could use a vector, but let's be explicit */\n    Mock *mockTom;\n    Mock *mockDick;\n    Mock *mockHarry;\n\n    int createdHorses = 0;\n    // onConstructorCalled() is created by Deride and called when the mocked\n    // Horse object is created\n    Animals::MockHorse::onConstructorCalled([&](const std::string &name) {\n        std::cout << \"Horse instantiated: \" << name << std::endl;\n        createdHorses++;\n        if (name == \"Tom\") {\n            mockTom = Mock::latestInstance();\n        } else if (name == \"Dick\") {\n            mockDick = Mock::latestInstance();\n        } else if (name == \"Harry\") {\n            mockHarry = Mock::latestInstance();\n        } else {\n            assert(false); // should not be reached\n        }\n    });\n\n    Stable stable;\n    stable.createHorses(horseNames);\n    /* It's at this point that the contructor callbacks we defined above will\n     * have been called.

            "html": "<p>I've been working in Scrum teams for 15 years now, give or take. Different\ncompanies, different approaches, from loosely following the agile principles to\na stricter implementation of the Scrum methodology. The only invariant being\nthat in practice Scrum is never followed by the book, but every company and\nteam makes its own adaptations, which makes it hard for everyone to voice\nstatements and critiques that could be considered universally true. That's why I\nwill refrain from taking this road, and instead I'll try to point out a few\naspects and behaviours that I've personally noticed during my career, good and\nbad ones (but of course, since I'm old and bitter, more bad than good).</p>\n<p>Scrum's focus on communication is, in my opinion, where most of its value lies\non: it's indeed important that other team members know what you are doing, and\nthat management has an idea of the progress being made. Hence daily standups\nand the scrum board, and demos and retrospective at the end of each sprint.</p>\n<p>It makes sense, on paper. And in practice as well, if you find yourself in a\nteam which is not really a team but a group of individuals with communication\nproblems. But that should not be the rule, and that's my main criticism of\nScrum: it's <strong>a very good system for managing poorly skilled developers</strong>.</p>\n<p>In a highly skilled team, all of the benefits that Scrum is supposed to bring\nare already a given: back in 2006-2008, in Nokia, most of our communication was\noccurring in IRC and mailing lists. The fact that some of our co-workers were\n<a href=\"https://www.collabora.com/\">remote</a> indeed acted as a push for this choice.\nThe same occurred in my early years at Canonical, where (at least in my team)\nwe had a video conference only once per week: if the communication is already\nhappening in an open (to the team members) place, there's no need for further\nsynchronisation points. And if the managers and product owners are also\nmonitoring these discussions, they know perfectly well how the situation is and\ncan report it further up.</p>\n<h4>Demos</h4>\n<p>What about demos? Having always worked on middleware and system programming,\nwhere there's very little to <em>show</em>, I've never been fond of demos. Our team\ndemos have always been boring and of little significance for most of their\nspectators. And while it can take a lot of time to prepare a demo, if we\nalready communicated what he have done in this sprint, what's the point of\nspending more time for the demo? Is it a lack of trust? Or is it a way to make\nthe team proud of its accomplishments?\nIn any case, the same could be achieved in a more efficient way: have a\nspecialized person (maybe from the QA team) prepare and run all the demos. In\nthis way you'd not only achieve those goals, but you'd also make sure that\nthere's no cheating (ehmm…) and that bugs are noticed right away.</p>\n<h4>Story estimations</h4>\n<p>Luckily so far I've been involved in only two projects where it was required to\nestimate the complexity of the backlog stories. But it was enough to convince\nme that there's something fundamentally wrong with it. On one hand, we are\nbeing told that we should estimate <em>complexity</em>, and not <em>time</em>, but then the\nstory points are being used to decide how many stories can fit in a\nsprint. It can make sense to estimate the complexity, indeed, because it's an\nintrinsic property of the story, which typically does not depend on the actual\nperson who sits down to work on it; but then what can we use this value for?\nAnd how much time are we willing to spend in order to figure out this nearly\nuseless magic number? We keep the whole team sitting down together while\nthrowing estimates, and then question them; and indeed, in order to let other\npeople express a reasonable estimate we should also explain the story with a\ncertain level of detail. And while this sounds like a worthwhile thing to do\n(explaining the story, I mean), it's probably better to do that in written\nform, and ask the team members to read all the stories <em>before</em> the grooming\nsession. This is what we have been doing at some point, except that most of the\ntime there would be at least one colleague who hadn't done his homework, so you\nstill had to either retell the story during the meeting, or have the complexity\ndiscussion anyway since not all estimates were in agreement.</p>\n<p>Having a clear description on all the stories (where a “clear description”\ncould even be just a link to a bug report, if that contains enough information)\ndoes not cost a lot of time, as long as the description is written by a single\ndeveloper and not during a meeting with the whole team. It brings the benefit\nthat while writing the story one might realize that there's more to it and this\ncan lead to the creation of additional stories <em>before</em> one actually starts the\nsprint.</p>\n<p>If, for whatever reason, a point score is absolutely required (just because\nupper management wants so), then this should probably happen as the description\nis being written, and can be set by the author alone; no need to gather the\nwhole team for this (since, in any case, the score is inevitably linked to how\nthe story's creator presents it).</p>\n<h4>Sprint planning</h4>\n<p>It is my firm believe that a team member with no stories assigned should always\nbe allowed to drag the topmost story from the backlog (who should be kept in\nthe desired order by the product owner) into the sprint, without needing any\nkind of approval from above.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, I've been working on teams where this was actively discouraged,\nif not prohibited. The rationale being that all stories that we bring into the\nsprint are a commitment, and that once the <em>TODO</em> column is empty, everybody who\nis free of other work should help their colleagues to complete their stories\nwhich are still in progress.  This sounds good in theory, but in practice it\nmakes little sense, unless the stories still in progress can be reasonably\nsplit into smaller parts (and most of the times they can't).</p>\n<p>So, a lot of effort is made in order to plan a sprint so that all of its\nstories can be completed, and at the end of the sprint one can look at the\nburn-down chart and feel proud of that diagonal line having gotten so close to\nthe horizontal axis.  Except that everybody knows that we are just fooling\nourselves, because that beautiful graph is only the result of us undercommitting\non the sprint planning and then avoiding to bring in more stories into the\nsprint once we had the resources to do so.</p>\n<h4>Every developer is worth 1</h4>\n<p>It seems to me that Scrum works under the assumption that all members of a team\nare interchangeable, and that it does not matter which developer takes up which\nstory. It has been like this at least in one of the projects I worked in: as\nsoon as you'd finish working on your story, it was mandatory to pick the\ntopmost story from the <em>TODO</em> column, whatever it might be. Not the second or\nthe third one: you were allowed to pick the first one only. The reason for this\nis that we had some stories that no one wanted to work on, and they'd risk\ngetting delayed forever.  But this “solution” caused another issue, because if\nthe topmost item in the <em>TODO</em> column was an uninspiring story, this made so\nthat developers would be slower and hesitant in finishing their current\nstories; no one would openly talk about that, but it was something you could\neasily sense, as people started to find issues in their code, adding more unit\ntests than usual, or “inadvertently” picking up the <em>second</em> topmost story from\nthe <em>TODO</em> column.\nSo, a problem that could have been easily solved by authority (just let the PO\nor the lead developer decide who should do what) would become another source of\ninefficiency.</p>\n<p>A slightly related issue is the fact that if a team is very inhomogeneous, and\nwe estimate the stories just by their complexity, we can't really predict\nwhether our sprint will be a successful one, because it all depends on which\ndeveloper works on which story. Believe it or not, I happened to complete\nin a handful of hours a story that a teammate had been working on for almost\none month (I assume he was also slacking off, but the point remains): at the\nstandups he was always reporting “good progress”, until I took the chance of\nhim having a day off and I stole the story from him.  One might argue that even if\na complexity estimation gives no forecast on when the story will be completed,\nit can still be used in cases like this, to detect the underperformers.  This\nis totally true, but that's the subject of <a href=\"http://www.mardy.it/blog/2022/10/performance-review.html\">another blog\npost</a>.</p>\n<h4>Rearranging developers in homogeneous teams</h4>\n<p>Besides, it should not come as a surprise that developers can have very\ndifferent skills, up to a factor of hundreds, if we take the extremes, and this\ncan be due to very different reasons: a low performance could be due to one\nbeing a junior developer, to personality issues, or just to a congenic lack of\nan analytic mindset.</p>\n<p>If on one side it makes sense to mix junior and experienced developers in the\nsame team in order to boost the productivity and skills of the junior\ndevelopers, the same does not hold true for good and bad developers: if one\nhasn't acquired the needed coding skills after a couple of years of work\nexperience, it's unlikely that continuing to have this developer work side by\nside with more experienced ones will bring much benefit to him. On the opposite\nside, it can stress out the more productive developer and demotivate him. Now\nthat a long time has passed, I can say that this is exactly what happened to me\nin a couple of occasions during my career (and the fact that these colleagues\ncontinuously argued and did not recognize their shortcomings did not help).</p>\n<p>You will never get a perfectly homogenous team, since people always have\ndifferent experience and skills; anyways, a little of gradation is healthy,\nbecause it stimulates all team members to compete in improving, by seeing each\nother as a model to surpass. But this only works if the target is felt as\nreachable (otherwise the lowest skilled developer won't have enough motivation)\nand worth reaching (otherwise the highest skilled developer will feel he has\nnothing to learn from the others).</p>\n<p>That's why, in my opinion, it's worth rearranging teams along skill levels: the\nteams with lower skill levels can benefit from being Scrum managed, because\nScrum sets up a frame inside which a low-skilled developer can still be\nproductive (albeit at a slower pace) thanks to the continuous monitoring and\nfeedback.  Highly skilled teams — which, incidentally, does not only mean good\ncoders, but also good teammates with prioritization and communication skills,\nand understanding the project goals and nearly capable of managing themselves —\ncould do very well even without Scrum, and just need a project owner who sets\nthe goals and defines the high-level stories (generally called “epics”), which\nthey can then break into smaller tasks by themselves. Adding more Scrum to\nsuch teams might not lead to any improvement.</p>\n<h4>What about managers?</h4>\n<p>I tend to think on a similar vein when it comes to managers (be it project\nmanager or product owner): my impression is that Scrum is most beneficial when\nthe team has a poor manager, because it sets some rules that make the figure of\nthe manager less relevant and reduce it to a role that can be easily performed\nby almost anyone. Here I might be totally wrong, of course, since I've never\nworked as a manager and there are aspects of their job that are less visible\nand that I might be overlooking; but again, I think that a good manager makes\nScrum redundant. Being crystal clear about the team goals, setting up a work\nenvironment that stimulates every team member to give his best, being able to\nnotice early when things are not going as planned or when someone is\nunderperforming or not feeling at ease, making sure that the current\ndevelopment stage is well understood by the rest of the project, etc.: all\nthese things are also Scrum's goals, so if they are already happening, the\ncompany should cherish this manager as a role model and question whether\nScrum would be really beneficial here.</p>\n<h4>Conclusion</h4>\n<p>In other words, summing up, one company/department should consider introducing\nScrum once a problem has been detected; “as long as the boat goes, let it go”,\nas a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVGGCf_i1y4\">popular Italian song</a> says.</p>",

That's why I\nwill refrain from taking this road, and instead I'll try to point out a few\naspects and behaviours that I've personally noticed during my career, good and\nbad ones (but of course, since I'm old and bitter, more bad than good).\nScrum's focus on communication is, in my opinion, where most of its value lies\non: it's indeed important that other team members know what you are doing, and\nthat management has an idea of the progress being made. Hence daily standups\nand the scrum board, and demos and retrospective at the end of each sprint.\nIt makes sense, on paper. And in practice as well, if you find yourself in a\nteam which is not really a team but a group of individuals with communication\nproblems. But that should not be the rule, and that's my main criticism of\nScrum: it's a very good system for managing poorly skilled developers.\nIn a highly skilled team, all of the benefits that Scrum is supposed to bring\nare already a given: back in 2006-2008, in Nokia, most of our communication was\noccurring in IRC and mailing lists. The fact that some of our co-workers were\nremote indeed acted as a push for this choice.\nThe same occurred in my early years at Canonical, where (at least in my team)\nwe had a video conference only once per week: if the communication is already\nhappening in an open (to the team members) place, there's no need for further\nsynchronisation points. And if the managers and product owners are also\nmonitoring these discussions, they know perfectly well how the situation is and\ncan report it further up.\nDemos\nWhat about demos? Having always worked on middleware and system programming,\nwhere there's very little to show, I've never been fond of demos. Our team\ndemos have always been boring and of little significance for most of their\nspectators. And while it can take a lot of time to prepare a demo, if we\nalready communicated what he have done in this sprint, what's the point of\nspending more time for the demo? Is it a lack of trust? Or is it a way to make\nthe team proud of its accomplishments?\nIn any case, the same could be achieved in a more efficient way: have a\nspecialized person (maybe from the QA team) prepare and run all the demos. In\nthis way you'd not only achieve those goals, but you'd also make sure that\nthere's no cheating (ehmm…) and that bugs are noticed right away.\nStory estimations\nLuckily so far I've been involved in only two projects where it was required to\nestimate the complexity of the backlog stories. But it was enough to convince\nme that there's something fundamentally wrong with it. On one hand, we are\nbeing told that we should estimate complexity, and not time, but then the\nstory points are being used to decide how many stories can fit in a\nsprint. It can make sense to estimate the complexity, indeed, because it's an\nintrinsic property of the story, which typically does not depend on the actual\nperson who sits down to work on it; but then what can we use this value for?\nAnd how much time are we willing to spend in order to figure out this nearly\nuseless magic number? We keep the whole team sitting down together while\nthrowing estimates, and then question them; and indeed, in order to let other\npeople express a reasonable estimate we should also explain the story with a\ncertain level of detail. And while this sounds like a worthwhile thing to do\n(explaining the story, I mean), it's probably better to do that in written\nform, and ask the team members to read all the stories before the grooming\nsession. This is what we have been doing at some point, except that most of the\ntime there would be at least one colleague who hadn't done his homework, so you\nstill had to either retell the story during the meeting, or have the complexity\ndiscussion anyway since not all estimates were in agreement.\nHaving a clear description on all the stories (where a “clear description”\ncould even be just a link to a bug report, if that contains enough information)\ndoes not cost a lot of time, as long as the description is written by a single\ndeveloper and not during a meeting with the whole team. It brings the benefit\nthat while writing the story one might realize that there's more to it and this\ncan lead to the creation of additional stories before one actually starts the\nsprint.\nIf, for whatever reason, a point score is absolutely required (just because\nupper management wants so), then this should probably happen as the description\nis being written, and can be set by the author alone; no need to gather the\nwhole team for this (since, in any case, the score is inevitably linked to how\nthe story's creator presents it).\nSprint planning\nIt is my firm believe that a team member with no stories assigned should always\nbe allowed to drag the topmost story from the backlog (who should be kept in\nthe desired order by the product owner) into the sprint, without needing any\nkind of approval from above.\nUnfortunately, I've been working on teams where this was actively discouraged,\nif not prohibited. The rationale being that all stories that we bring into the\nsprint are a commitment, and that once the TODO column is empty, everybody who\nis free of other work should help their colleagues to complete their stories\nwhich are still in progress.  This sounds good in theory, but in practice it\nmakes little sense, unless the stories still in progress can be reasonably\nsplit into smaller parts (and most of the times they can't).\nSo, a lot of effort is made in order to plan a sprint so that all of its\nstories can be completed, and at the end of the sprint one can look at the\nburn-down chart and feel proud of that diagonal line having gotten so close to\nthe horizontal axis.  Except that everybody knows that we are just fooling\nourselves, because that beautiful graph is only the result of us undercommitting\non the sprint planning and then avoiding to bring in more stories into the\nsprint once we had the resources to do so.\nEvery developer is worth 1\nIt seems to me that Scrum works under the assumption that all members of a team\nare interchangeable, and that it does not matter which developer takes up which\nstory. It has been like this at least in one of the projects I worked in: as\nsoon as you'd finish working on your story, it was mandatory to pick the\ntopmost story from the TODO column, whatever it might be. Not the second or\nthe third one: you were allowed to pick the first one only. The reason for this\nis that we had some stories that no one wanted to work on, and they'd risk\ngetting delayed forever.  But this “solution” caused another issue, because if\nthe topmost item in the TODO column was an uninspiring story, this made so\nthat developers would be slower and hesitant in finishing their current\nstories; no one would openly talk about that, but it was something you could\neasily sense, as people started to find issues in their code, adding more unit\ntests than usual, or “inadvertently” picking up the second topmost story from\nthe TODO column.\nSo, a problem that could have been easily solved by authority (just let the PO\nor the lead developer decide who should do what) would become another source of\ninefficiency.\nA slightly related issue is the fact that if a team is very inhomogeneous, and\nwe estimate the stories just by their complexity, we can't really predict\nwhether our sprint will be a successful one, because it all depends on which\ndeveloper works on which story. Believe it or not, I happened to complete\nin a handful of hours a story that a teammate had been working on for almost\none month (I assume he was also slacking off, but the point remains): at the\nstandups he was always reporting “good progress”, until I took the chance of\nhim having a day off and I stole the story from him.  One might argue that even if\na complexity estimation gives no forecast on when the story will be completed,\nit can still be used in cases like this, to detect the underperformers.  This\nis totally true, but that's the subject of another blog\npost.\nRearranging developers in homogeneous teams\nBesides, it should not come as a surprise that developers can have very\ndifferent skills, up to a factor of hundreds, if we take the extremes, and this\ncan be due to very different reasons: a low performance could be due to one\nbeing a junior developer, to personality issues, or just to a congenic lack of\nan analytic mindset.\nIf on one side it makes sense to mix junior and experienced developers in the\nsame team in order to boost the productivity and skills of the junior\ndevelopers, the same does not hold true for good and bad developers: if one\nhasn't acquired the needed coding skills after a couple of years of work\nexperience, it's unlikely that continuing to have this developer work side by\nside with more experienced ones will bring much benefit to him. On the opposite\nside, it can stress out the more productive developer and demotivate him. Now\nthat a long time has passed, I can say that this is exactly what happened to me\nin a couple of occasions during my career (and the fact that these colleagues\ncontinuously argued and did not recognize their shortcomings did not help).\nYou will never get a perfectly homogenous team, since people always have\ndifferent experience and skills; anyways, a little of gradation is healthy,\nbecause it stimulates all team members to compete in improving, by seeing each\nother as a model to surpass. But this only works if the target is felt as\nreachable (otherwise the lowest skilled developer won't have enough motivation)\nand worth reaching (otherwise the highest skilled developer will feel he has\nnothing to learn from the others).\nThat's why, in my opinion, it's worth rearranging teams along skill levels: the\nteams with lower skill levels can benefit from being Scrum managed, because\nScrum sets up a frame inside which a low-skilled developer can still be\nproductive (albeit at a slower pace) thanks to the continuous monitoring and\nfeedback.  Highly skilled teams — which, incidentally, does not only mean good\ncoders, but also good teammates with prioritization and communication skills,\nand understanding the project goals and nearly capable of managing themselves —\ncould do very well even without Scrum, and just need a project owner who sets\nthe goals and defines the high-level stories (generally called “epics”), which\nthey can then break into smaller tasks by themselves. Adding more Scrum to\nsuch teams might not lead to any improvement.\nWhat about managers?\nI tend to think on a similar vein when it comes to managers (be it project\nmanager or product owner): my impression is that Scrum is most beneficial when\nthe team has a poor manager, because it sets some rules that make the figure of\nthe manager less relevant and reduce it to a role that can be easily performed\nby almost anyone. Here I might be totally wrong, of course, since I've never\nworked as a manager and there are aspects of their job that are less visible\nand that I might be overlooking; but again, I think that a good manager makes\nScrum redundant. Being crystal clear about the team goals, setting up a work\nenvironment that stimulates every team member to give his best, being able to\nnotice early when things are not going as planned or when someone is\nunderperforming or not feeling at ease, making sure that the current\ndevelopment stage is well understood by the rest of the project, etc.: all\nthese things are also Scrum's goals, so if they are already happening, the\ncompany should cherish this manager as a role model and question whether\nScrum would be really beneficial here.\nConclusion\nIn other words, summing up, one company/department should consider introducing\nScrum once a problem has been detected; “as long as the boat goes, let it go”,\nas a popular Italian song says."
