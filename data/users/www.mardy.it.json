That's why I've restricted my job search to companies having an\nofficial presence in Russia; and to my surprise (and from some point of view, I\ncould even say disappointment) the selection and hiring processes were so\nquick that I received three concrete offers while I was still working my last\nweeks at Canonical, and I joined OMP on that very Monday after my last Friday\nat Canonical.\nI mean, I could have rested a bit, at least until the Christmas holidays, but\nno. ☺  Anyway, I'm so far very happy with my new job, and speaking Russian at\nwork is something totally new for me, both challenging and rewarding at the\nsame time."

            "html": "<p>Before you get angry at me for this title, please let me state that I count\nmyself in the number of the “idiots” and, secondly, that what I mean by\n“idiotism” here is not to be intended as an offence, but as some traits of\nmindset which are typical of very logical brains.</p>\n<p>Some months ago I finished reading Dostoevskiy's “The Idiot”, a book about an\nexceedingly good-hearted man, prince Lev Mishkin, whose behaviour was puzzling\nthe people around him so much that they thought of him as an idiot. Sure, the\nfact that he was suffering from epilepsy didn't help, but it was far from being\nthe primary reason for their thinking, since his epileptic seizures were very\nrare (if I remember correctly, only two occurred during the time of the story)\nand everybody's opinion had already formed well ahead of witnessing him in such\na state.</p>\n<p>He was an idiot because he was open, trustful, and especially because he could\nnot “read between the lines” of what was been said to him: his social conduct\nwas straight, and although he was following at his best the customs that he had\nbeen taught, he was supposedly awkward and unable to perceive and parse all the\nmessages that are implicitly conveyed by social behaviours and human\ninteractions. I added the word “supposedly” because, as a matter of fact, his\nbehaviours were all perfectly normal for me: I only noticed their awkwardness\nwhen it was pointed out by the other characters, at which point I couldn't help\nsmiling and acknowledging that, indeed, that thing he did was weird.</p>\n<p>However, he was a good and caring person, and not without talents: he had an\ninterest in calligraphy, and everybody liked to listen to him, as his speech\nwas insightful and his thoughts were original. I wonder how many of my readers\ncan identify themselves in such a character?</p>\n<p>I definitely can. I won't get into the details, but I've felt many times on me\nthe amused or puzzled glance of people (like that time in high school when I\ncould not open a door in front of dozens of people, and I heard them say “So,\nthat guy is the genius of mathematics?” — I'll never forget that!), often\nwithout understanding the reason for their reactions. Still, generally people\nseem to like my company and be genuinely interested in talking to me.</p>\n<p>So, what's wrong with prince Lev Mishkin, me, and maybe with you too? Well, a few\nthings, I would say. I'm not going to claim any scientific truth on what I'm\ngoing to say, these are just my own impressions and deductions, which seem\nto be shared by other people in the interwebs too, judging from a quick search\nI did; take them for what they are.</p>\n<p>The first thing I notice is some common traits between us and autistic people:\nwe tend to work better with things, rather than with people; we can to focus on\na certain thing (work, a mathematical problem, a game) and forget about the\nworld around us; we have our unique hobbies, like solving puzzles, arguing\nabout a specific and very narrow topic, learning artificial (both human and\nprogramming) languages; it's as if we needed to build a small, better world\nwhere we would feel safe and at ease.</p>\n<p>The other thing, which I actually consider harmful and which I put efforts to\nchange in my own life, is the fact that it's extremely easy to get us\ninterested into a specific aspect of a problem, and make us forget (or just not\nnotice) the big picture. That small part that we are looking at is stimulating\nand challenging, and we are led to think that it's core of the issue, and maybe\nof all the issues that affect our world. What is often missing is the ability\nto take one step back and try to look at the issue from a different angle, and\nespecially the ability to listen for counter arguments; I mean, we do listen to\nthem, but since we have, in a way, “gamified” the issue, even when we think\nthat we are open to listen for the other side, we are in reality trying to win\nthe counter-arguments, rather than genuinely trying to understanding them.</p>\n<p>Another thing which we have, is faith. Yes, you read it right: even though the\nIT world is probably the one with the highest percentage of atheists, men\nalways need something to believe in. We just don't realize it, but we do hold a\nblind trust in certain persons and authorities. This does not mean that this\ntrust lives forever and cannot be broken, but this generally does not occur\nbecause of a conscious realization of ours. Much more often than we'd like to\nadmit, the reason why we lose faith in a certain person or authority is because\n<em>the rest of the persons and authorities that we trust has told us so</em>. In\nother words, even if there's undoubtedly a reasoning of our own, the full\nrealisation and conviction occurs after having collected and compared the\nopinions (or statements) of those we trust. The net result is that the IT\npopulation is the one most trustful of the mainstream media, because it's the\nmainstream media who has more “voice”: that's where the most <em>reputable</em>\njournalists, scientists, activists are (and “reputable” is the key word here,\nsince this reputation is recursively created by the mainstream media\nthemselves or by their sponsors).</p>\n<p>I might be biased by my own experience here, but it seems to me that there\nisn't a group of people more homogenous in their political (and generally,\nworld) views than that of IT workers. When, in 2018, I saw the leaked video of\nGoogle's co-founder Sergei Brin and other executives' reaction at Trump's\npresidential victory, what I found most surprising was not the contents of the\nspeech, as they were mostly mainstream opinions, but rather the fact that all\nthis could be said in a company meeting. Something like this, I though, could\nnever happen in an European company, as political matters are a conventional\ntabu in the work environment. But the point is that Brin and others could say\nthose words only because <em>they knew</em> that the overwhelming majority of the\naudience shared the same opinion. I don't think you could find the same\nhomogeneity of thought among shop assistants or philosophy professors.</p>\n<p>Assuming that you have followed me this far into my rambling, and that you\nrecognize that there might be some truth in what I wrote, you might now be\nwondering if there's a way to counterbalance our “idiotic” traits.\nUnfortunately I don't have a full answer, as myself am only halfway there (but\nmaybe I'm too optimistic here? and does this road even ever end?), but there\nare a few things that I think are absolutely worth trying:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Talk with people. Better if face to face, or at least in a video call; just\n  1-on-1, avoid groups, or you'll get on the defensive and try to defend your\n  position for the sake of not losing the argument in front of an audience. But\n  it's not a fight. Your goal when talking should not be that of convincing or\n  getting convinced, but rather just to <em>understand</em> the other points of view.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Read both sides of the narrative. Try to see the other party's argument as\n  they themselves present it, and not how it is presented in the media you\n  usually read. Media often use this trick, to either invite “clown\n  representatives” of the other point of view just to ridicule it, or they give them\n  too little time, or extrapolate their answer out of context, just to make\n  them appear unsensible.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Always assume that other people are smart, and that no one is bad.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Whatever the argument, try to answer the key question: “Cui bono?” (who\n  profits?) to be at least aware of all the hidden interests behind this and\n  that. They don't necessarily invalidate a position, but they must be\n  considered.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Lose faith. The only faith you are allowed to keep is the faith in God (or\n  Gods), if you have it: but men, theories, institutions, authorities\n  (including religious ones!), these must always be assumed to be imperfect and\n  not blindly trusted.  People serve their interests or can be manipulated. Try\n  always to start from a clean table and an empty mind, and see if they have\n  enough arguments to convince you. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Do never assume “They can not <em>all</em> be wrong” or “If this were wrong, at\n  least some media would report it”. It just doesn't work this way, this is\n  again a matter of having faith in the majority. Think of how many times in\n  (recent) history you were presented an unambiguous truth, which later came\n  out to be a scam (Iraq war being a famous one).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Defocus. You might be spending a lot of energy into something that's not\n  worth it. I mean, feel free to pursue whatever hobbies you like, as long as\n  they make you feel better. But if you think you have a <em>mission</em>, think twice\n  about it. Think about the world you'd like to live in, and whether/how this\n  mission contributes to it.<sup id=\"fnref:saudi\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"http://www.mardy.it/blog/2022/11/the-idiotism-of-software-developers.html#fn:saudi\">2</a></sup></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Ask questions. Be curious. Be challenging. For any topic, there are questions\n  that have not been answered in mainstream media<sup id=\"fnref:refugees\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"http://www.mardy.it/blog/2022/11/the-idiotism-of-software-developers.html#fn:refugees\">1</a></sup>. Find the answer,\n  then find explanations, never stopping at the first satisfactory one, but\n  always get at least two competing answers. From here, ask more questions,\n  rinse and repeat. And at every step ask yourself this: why didn't I know\n  about this? Is someone trying to hide the truth from me?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Aim at improving. Whenever you read something or talk to people, keep a\n  humble attitude and try to be challenged. Your goal should be that every\n  reading and every dialog should make you wiser, even if what you initially\n  read and heard sounded like garbage. There are always reasons for all these\n  thoughts you disagree with.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Reach out to the people nearby. Try not just to be sympathetic to the needs of\n  some population living far away from you, which the media has singled out as\n  being those needing your compassion, and try instead (or in addition to that)\n  to be sympathetic and helpful to the people around you. To your neighbours,\n  to those you see in the public transport and, first and foremost, to your\n  relatives.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Summing up, what I want you to realize is that we IT workers are easily\nexploitable. All those thought manipulation techniques represent a problem to\neveryone, but it's particularly with us that they tend to be especially\neffective; as a matter of fact, I've found that awareness of how the power\ncontrols us is higher among uneducated people, because they are more\ndistrustful of the media and just tend to consume less of it. We, on the other\nhand, are not only well educated to respect the authority (see <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wv6TyJ1AbRM\">Noam Chomsky on\neducation</a>), but our logical,\ndetail-focused mind can be easily externally controlled by continuously\nstimulating it to focus on specific things and not others.</p>\n<p>How would Dostoevskiy call us?</p>\n<div class=\"footnote\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:refugees\">\n<p>My favourite one is: which country hosts more refugees from Ukraine? <a class=\"footnote-backref\" href=\"http://www.mardy.it/blog/2022/11/the-idiotism-of-software-developers.html#fnref:refugees\" title=\"Jump back to footnote 1 in the text\">↩</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn:saudi\">\n<p>I was recently surprised when I read people in a forum who were\ndiscussing avoiding doing business with Saudi Arabia because of their human\nrights record.

            "value": "Before you get angry at me for this title, please let me state that I count\nmyself in the number of the “idiots” and, secondly, that what I mean by\n“idiotism” here is not to be intended as an offence, but as some traits of\nmindset which are typical of very logical brains.\nSome months ago I finished reading Dostoevskiy's “The Idiot”, a book about an\nexceedingly good-hearted man, prince Lev Mishkin, whose behaviour was puzzling\nthe people around him so much that they thought of him as an idiot. Sure, the\nfact that he was suffering from epilepsy didn't help, but it was far from being\nthe primary reason for their thinking, since his epileptic seizures were very\nrare (if I remember correctly, only two occurred during the time of the story)\nand everybody's opinion had already formed well ahead of witnessing him in such\na state.\nHe was an idiot because he was open, trustful, and especially because he could\nnot “read between the lines” of what was been said to him: his social conduct\nwas straight, and although he was following at his best the customs that he had\nbeen taught, he was supposedly awkward and unable to perceive and parse all the\nmessages that are implicitly conveyed by social behaviours and human\ninteractions. I added the word “supposedly” because, as a matter of fact, his\nbehaviours were all perfectly normal for me: I only noticed their awkwardness\nwhen it was pointed out by the other characters, at which point I couldn't help\nsmiling and acknowledging that, indeed, that thing he did was weird.\nHowever, he was a good and caring person, and not without talents: he had an\ninterest in calligraphy, and everybody liked to listen to him, as his speech\nwas insightful and his thoughts were original. I wonder how many of my readers\ncan identify themselves in such a character?\nI definitely can. I won't get into the details, but I've felt many times on me\nthe amused or puzzled glance of people (like that time in high school when I\ncould not open a door in front of dozens of people, and I heard them say “So,\nthat guy is the genius of mathematics?” — I'll never forget that!), often\nwithout understanding the reason for their reactions. Still, generally people\nseem to like my company and be genuinely interested in talking to me.\nSo, what's wrong with prince Lev Mishkin, me, and maybe with you too? Well, a few\nthings, I would say. I'm not going to claim any scientific truth on what I'm\ngoing to say, these are just my own impressions and deductions, which seem\nto be shared by other people in the interwebs too, judging from a quick search\nI did; take them for what they are.\nThe first thing I notice is some common traits between us and autistic people:\nwe tend to work better with things, rather than with people; we can to focus on\na certain thing (work, a mathematical problem, a game) and forget about the\nworld around us; we have our unique hobbies, like solving puzzles, arguing\nabout a specific and very narrow topic, learning artificial (both human and\nprogramming) languages; it's as if we needed to build a small, better world\nwhere we would feel safe and at ease.\nThe other thing, which I actually consider harmful and which I put efforts to\nchange in my own life, is the fact that it's extremely easy to get us\ninterested into a specific aspect of a problem, and make us forget (or just not\nnotice) the big picture. That small part that we are looking at is stimulating\nand challenging, and we are led to think that it's core of the issue, and maybe\nof all the issues that affect our world. What is often missing is the ability\nto take one step back and try to look at the issue from a different angle, and\nespecially the ability to listen for counter arguments; I mean, we do listen to\nthem, but since we have, in a way, “gamified” the issue, even when we think\nthat we are open to listen for the other side, we are in reality trying to win\nthe counter-arguments, rather than genuinely trying to understanding them.\nAnother thing which we have, is faith. Yes, you read it right: even though the\nIT world is probably the one with the highest percentage of atheists, men\nalways need something to believe in. We just don't realize it, but we do hold a\nblind trust in certain persons and authorities. This does not mean that this\ntrust lives forever and cannot be broken, but this generally does not occur\nbecause of a conscious realization of ours. Much more often than we'd like to\nadmit, the reason why we lose faith in a certain person or authority is because\nthe rest of the persons and authorities that we trust has told us so. In\nother words, even if there's undoubtedly a reasoning of our own, the full\nrealisation and conviction occurs after having collected and compared the\nopinions (or statements) of those we trust. The net result is that the IT\npopulation is the one most trustful of the mainstream media, because it's the\nmainstream media who has more “voice”: that's where the most reputable\njournalists, scientists, activists are (and “reputable” is the key word here,\nsince this reputation is recursively created by the mainstream media\nthemselves or by their sponsors).\nI might be biased by my own experience here, but it seems to me that there\nisn't a group of people more homogenous in their political (and generally,\nworld) views than that of IT workers. When, in 2018, I saw the leaked video of\nGoogle's co-founder Sergei Brin and other executives' reaction at Trump's\npresidential victory, what I found most surprising was not the contents of the\nspeech, as they were mostly mainstream opinions, but rather the fact that all\nthis could be said in a company meeting. Something like this, I though, could\nnever happen in an European company, as political matters are a conventional\ntabu in the work environment. But the point is that Brin and others could say\nthose words only because they knew that the overwhelming majority of the\naudience shared the same opinion. I don't think you could find the same\nhomogeneity of thought among shop assistants or philosophy professors.\nAssuming that you have followed me this far into my rambling, and that you\nrecognize that there might be some truth in what I wrote, you might now be\nwondering if there's a way to counterbalance our “idiotic” traits.\nUnfortunately I don't have a full answer, as myself am only halfway there (but\nmaybe I'm too optimistic here? and does this road even ever end?), but there\nare a few things that I think are absolutely worth trying:\n\n\nTalk with people. Better if face to face, or at least in a video call; just\n  1-on-1, avoid groups, or you'll get on the defensive and try to defend your\n  position for the sake of not losing the argument in front of an audience. But\n  it's not a fight. Your goal when talking should not be that of convincing or\n  getting convinced, but rather just to understand the other points of view.\n\n\nRead both sides of the narrative. Try to see the other party's argument as\n  they themselves present it, and not how it is presented in the media you\n  usually read. Media often use this trick, to either invite “clown\n  representatives” of the other point of view just to ridicule it, or they give them\n  too little time, or extrapolate their answer out of context, just to make\n  them appear unsensible.\n\n\nAlways assume that other people are smart, and that no one is bad.\n\n\nWhatever the argument, try to answer the key question: “Cui bono?” (who\n  profits?) to be at least aware of all the hidden interests behind this and\n  that. They don't necessarily invalidate a position, but they must be\n  considered.\n\n\nLose faith. The only faith you are allowed to keep is the faith in God (or\n  Gods), if you have it: but men, theories, institutions, authorities\n  (including religious ones!), these must always be assumed to be imperfect and\n  not blindly trusted.  People serve their interests or can be manipulated. Try\n  always to start from a clean table and an empty mind, and see if they have\n  enough arguments to convince you. \n\n\nDo never assume “They can not all be wrong” or “If this were wrong, at\n  least some media would report it”. It just doesn't work this way, this is\n  again a matter of having faith in the majority. Think of how many times in\n  (recent) history you were presented an unambiguous truth, which later came\n  out to be a scam (Iraq war being a famous one).\n\n\nDefocus. You might be spending a lot of energy into something that's not\n  worth it. I mean, feel free to pursue whatever hobbies you like, as long as\n  they make you feel better. But if you think you have a mission, think twice\n  about it. Think about the world you'd like to live in, and whether/how this\n  mission contributes to it.2\n\n\nAsk questions. Be curious. Be challenging. For any topic, there are questions\n  that have not been answered in mainstream media1. Find the answer,\n  then find explanations, never stopping at the first satisfactory one, but\n  always get at least two competing answers. From here, ask more questions,\n  rinse and repeat. And at every step ask yourself this: why didn't I know\n  about this? Is someone trying to hide the truth from me?\n\n\nAim at improving. Whenever you read something or talk to people, keep a\n  humble attitude and try to be challenged. Your goal should be that every\n  reading and every dialog should make you wiser, even if what you initially\n  read and heard sounded like garbage. There are always reasons for all these\n  thoughts you disagree with.\n\n\nReach out to the people nearby. Try not just to be sympathetic to the needs of\n  some population living far away from you, which the media has singled out as\n  being those needing your compassion, and try instead (or in addition to that)\n  to be sympathetic and helpful to the people around you. To your neighbours,\n  to those you see in the public transport and, first and foremost, to your\n  relatives.\n\n\nSumming up, what I want you to realize is that we IT workers are easily\nexploitable. All those thought manipulation techniques represent a problem to\neveryone, but it's particularly with us that they tend to be especially\neffective; as a matter of fact, I've found that awareness of how the power\ncontrols us is higher among uneducated people, because they are more\ndistrustful of the media and just tend to consume less of it. We, on the other\nhand, are not only well educated to respect the authority (see Noam Chomsky on\neducation), but our logical,\ndetail-focused mind can be easily externally controlled by continuously\nstimulating it to focus on specific things and not others.\nHow would Dostoevskiy call us?\n\n\n\n\nMy favourite one is: which country hosts more refugees from Ukraine? ↩\n\n\nI was recently surprised when I read people in a forum who were\ndiscussing avoiding doing business with Saudi Arabia because of their human\nrights record. Seriously? We are talking about a government who has indirectly\ncaused the death of more than 300 thousands people in Yemen, and your main\nreason to criticize them is human rights? It's like asking the police to arrest\na killer because before the assassination he misgendered his victim! Yet the\nelephant in the room continues to go unseen. ↩"
