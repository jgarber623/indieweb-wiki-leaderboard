            "html": "<p>I've been working in Scrum teams for 15 years now, give or take. Different\ncompanies, different approaches, from loosely following the agile principles to\na stricter implementation of the Scrum methodology. The only invariant being\nthat in practice Scrum is never followed by the book, but every company and\nteam makes its own adaptations, which makes it hard for everyone to voice\nstatements and critiques that could be considered universally true. That's why I\nwill refrain from taking this road, and instead I'll try to point out a few\naspects and behaviours that I've personally noticed during my career, good and\nbad ones (but of course, since I'm old and bitter, more bad than good).</p>\n<p>Scrum's focus on communication is, in my opinion, where most of its value lies\non: it's indeed important that other team members know what you are doing, and\nthat management has an idea of the progress being made. Hence daily standups\nand the scrum board, and demos and retrospective at the end of each sprint.</p>\n<p>It makes sense, on paper. And in practice as well, if you find yourself in a\nteam which is not really a team but a group of individuals with communication\nproblems. But that should not be the rule, and that's my main criticism of\nScrum: it's <strong>a very good system for managing poorly skilled developers</strong>.</p>\n<p>In a highly skilled team, all of the benefits that Scrum is supposed to bring\nare already a given: back in 2006-2008, in Nokia, most of our communication was\noccurring in IRC and mailing lists. The fact that some of our co-workers were\n<a href=\"https://www.collabora.com/\">remote</a> indeed acted as a push for this choice.\nThe same occurred in my early years at Canonical, where (at least in my team)\nwe had a video conference only once per week: if the communication is already\nhappening in an open (to the team members) place, there's no need for further\nsynchronisation points. And if the managers and product owners are also\nmonitoring these discussions, they know perfectly well how the situation is and\ncan report it further up.</p>\n<h4>Demos</h4>\n<p>What about demos? Having always worked on middleware and system programming,\nwhere there's very little to <em>show</em>, I've never been fond of demos. Our team\ndemos have always been boring and of little significance for most of their\nspectators. And while it can take a lot of time to prepare a demo, if we\nalready communicated what he have done in this sprint, what's the point of\nspending more time for the demo? Is it a lack of trust? Or is it a way to make\nthe team proud of its accomplishments?\nIn any case, the same could be achieved in a more efficient way: have a\nspecialized person (maybe from the QA team) prepare and run all the demos. In\nthis way you'd not only achieve those goals, but you'd also make sure that\nthere's no cheating (ehmm…) and that bugs are noticed right away.</p>\n<h4>Story estimations</h4>\n<p>Luckily so far I've been involved in only two projects where it was required to\nestimate the complexity of the backlog stories. But it was enough to convince\nme that there's something fundamentally wrong with it. On one hand, we are\nbeing told that we should estimate <em>complexity</em>, and not <em>time</em>, but then the\nstory points are being used to decide how many stories can fit in a\nsprint. It can make sense to estimate the complexity, indeed, because it's an\nintrinsic property of the story, which typically does not depend on the actual\nperson who sits down to work on it; but then what can we use this value for?\nAnd how much time are we willing to spend in order to figure out this nearly\nuseless magic number? We keep the whole team sitting down together while\nthrowing estimates, and then question them; and indeed, in order to let other\npeople express a reasonable estimate we should also explain the story with a\ncertain level of detail. And while this sounds like a worthwhile thing to do\n(explaining the story, I mean), it's probably better to do that in written\nform, and ask the team members to read all the stories <em>before</em> the grooming\nsession. This is what we have been doing at some point, except that most of the\ntime there would be at least one colleague who hadn't done his homework, so you\nstill had to either retell the story during the meeting, or have the complexity\ndiscussion anyway since not all estimates were in agreement.</p>\n<p>Having a clear description on all the stories (where a “clear description”\ncould even be just a link to a bug report, if that contains enough information)\ndoes not cost a lot of time, as long as the description is written by a single\ndeveloper and not during a meeting with the whole team. It brings the benefit\nthat while writing the story one might realize that there's more to it and this\ncan lead to the creation of additional stories <em>before</em> one actually starts the\nsprint.</p>\n<p>If, for whatever reason, a point score is absolutely required (just because\nupper management wants so), then this should probably happen as the description\nis being written, and can be set by the author alone; no need to gather the\nwhole team for this (since, in any case, the score is inevitably linked to how\nthe story's creator presents it).</p>\n<h4>Sprint planning</h4>\n<p>It is my firm believe that a team member with no stories assigned should always\nbe allowed to drag the topmost story from the backlog (who should be kept in\nthe desired order by the product owner) into the sprint, without needing any\nkind of approval from above.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, I've been working on teams where this was actively discouraged,\nif not prohibited. The rationale being that all stories that we bring into the\nsprint are a commitment, and that once the <em>TODO</em> column is empty, everybody who\nis free of other work should help their colleagues to complete their stories\nwhich are still in progress.  This sounds good in theory, but in practice it\nmakes little sense, unless the stories still in progress can be reasonably\nsplit into smaller parts (and most of the times they can't).</p>\n<p>So, a lot of effort is made in order to plan a sprint so that all of its\nstories can be completed, and at the end of the sprint one can look at the\nburn-down chart and feel proud of that diagonal line having gotten so close to\nthe horizontal axis.  Except that everybody knows that we are just fooling\nourselves, because that beautiful graph is only the result of us undercommitting\non the sprint planning and then avoiding to bring in more stories into the\nsprint once we had the resources to do so.</p>\n<h4>Every developer is worth 1</h4>\n<p>It seems to me that Scrum works under the assumption that all members of a team\nare interchangeable, and that it does not matter which developer takes up which\nstory. It has been like this at least in one of the projects I worked in: as\nsoon as you'd finish working on your story, it was mandatory to pick the\ntopmost story from the <em>TODO</em> column, whatever it might be.

            "value": "I've been working in Scrum teams for 15 years now, give or take. Different\ncompanies, different approaches, from loosely following the agile principles to\na stricter implementation of the Scrum methodology. The only invariant being\nthat in practice Scrum is never followed by the book, but every company and\nteam makes its own adaptations, which makes it hard for everyone to voice\nstatements and critiques that could be considered universally true. That's why I\nwill refrain from taking this road, and instead I'll try to point out a few\naspects and behaviours that I've personally noticed during my career, good and\nbad ones (but of course, since I'm old and bitter, more bad than good).\nScrum's focus on communication is, in my opinion, where most of its value lies\non: it's indeed important that other team members know what you are doing, and\nthat management has an idea of the progress being made. Hence daily standups\nand the scrum board, and demos and retrospective at the end of each sprint.\nIt makes sense, on paper. And in practice as well, if you find yourself in a\nteam which is not really a team but a group of individuals with communication\nproblems. But that should not be the rule, and that's my main criticism of\nScrum: it's a very good system for managing poorly skilled developers.\nIn a highly skilled team, all of the benefits that Scrum is supposed to bring\nare already a given: back in 2006-2008, in Nokia, most of our communication was\noccurring in IRC and mailing lists. The fact that some of our co-workers were\nremote indeed acted as a push for this choice.\nThe same occurred in my early years at Canonical, where (at least in my team)\nwe had a video conference only once per week: if the communication is already\nhappening in an open (to the team members) place, there's no need for further\nsynchronisation points. And if the managers and product owners are also\nmonitoring these discussions, they know perfectly well how the situation is and\ncan report it further up.\nDemos\nWhat about demos? Having always worked on middleware and system programming,\nwhere there's very little to show, I've never been fond of demos. Our team\ndemos have always been boring and of little significance for most of their\nspectators. And while it can take a lot of time to prepare a demo, if we\nalready communicated what he have done in this sprint, what's the point of\nspending more time for the demo? Is it a lack of trust? Or is it a way to make\nthe team proud of its accomplishments?\nIn any case, the same could be achieved in a more efficient way: have a\nspecialized person (maybe from the QA team) prepare and run all the demos. In\nthis way you'd not only achieve those goals, but you'd also make sure that\nthere's no cheating (ehmm…) and that bugs are noticed right away.\nStory estimations\nLuckily so far I've been involved in only two projects where it was required to\nestimate the complexity of the backlog stories. But it was enough to convince\nme that there's something fundamentally wrong with it. On one hand, we are\nbeing told that we should estimate complexity, and not time, but then the\nstory points are being used to decide how many stories can fit in a\nsprint. It can make sense to estimate the complexity, indeed, because it's an\nintrinsic property of the story, which typically does not depend on the actual\nperson who sits down to work on it; but then what can we use this value for?\nAnd how much time are we willing to spend in order to figure out this nearly\nuseless magic number? We keep the whole team sitting down together while\nthrowing estimates, and then question them; and indeed, in order to let other\npeople express a reasonable estimate we should also explain the story with a\ncertain level of detail. And while this sounds like a worthwhile thing to do\n(explaining the story, I mean), it's probably better to do that in written\nform, and ask the team members to read all the stories before the grooming\nsession. This is what we have been doing at some point, except that most of the\ntime there would be at least one colleague who hadn't done his homework, so you\nstill had to either retell the story during the meeting, or have the complexity\ndiscussion anyway since not all estimates were in agreement.\nHaving a clear description on all the stories (where a “clear description”\ncould even be just a link to a bug report, if that contains enough information)\ndoes not cost a lot of time, as long as the description is written by a single\ndeveloper and not during a meeting with the whole team. It brings the benefit\nthat while writing the story one might realize that there's more to it and this\ncan lead to the creation of additional stories before one actually starts the\nsprint.\nIf, for whatever reason, a point score is absolutely required (just because\nupper management wants so), then this should probably happen as the description\nis being written, and can be set by the author alone; no need to gather the\nwhole team for this (since, in any case, the score is inevitably linked to how\nthe story's creator presents it).\nSprint planning\nIt is my firm believe that a team member with no stories assigned should always\nbe allowed to drag the topmost story from the backlog (who should be kept in\nthe desired order by the product owner) into the sprint, without needing any\nkind of approval from above.\nUnfortunately, I've been working on teams where this was actively discouraged,\nif not prohibited. The rationale being that all stories that we bring into the\nsprint are a commitment, and that once the TODO column is empty, everybody who\nis free of other work should help their colleagues to complete their stories\nwhich are still in progress.  This sounds good in theory, but in practice it\nmakes little sense, unless the stories still in progress can be reasonably\nsplit into smaller parts (and most of the times they can't).\nSo, a lot of effort is made in order to plan a sprint so that all of its\nstories can be completed, and at the end of the sprint one can look at the\nburn-down chart and feel proud of that diagonal line having gotten so close to\nthe horizontal axis.  Except that everybody knows that we are just fooling\nourselves, because that beautiful graph is only the result of us undercommitting\non the sprint planning and then avoiding to bring in more stories into the\nsprint once we had the resources to do so.\nEvery developer is worth 1\nIt seems to me that Scrum works under the assumption that all members of a team\nare interchangeable, and that it does not matter which developer takes up which\nstory. It has been like this at least in one of the projects I worked in: as\nsoon as you'd finish working on your story, it was mandatory to pick the\ntopmost story from the TODO column, whatever it might be. Not the second or\nthe third one: you were allowed to pick the first one only. The reason for this\nis that we had some stories that no one wanted to work on, and they'd risk\ngetting delayed forever.  But this “solution” caused another issue, because if\nthe topmost item in the TODO column was an uninspiring story, this made so\nthat developers would be slower and hesitant in finishing their current\nstories; no one would openly talk about that, but it was something you could\neasily sense, as people started to find issues in their code, adding more unit\ntests than usual, or “inadvertently” picking up the second topmost story from\nthe TODO column.\nSo, a problem that could have been easily solved by authority (just let the PO\nor the lead developer decide who should do what) would become another source of\ninefficiency.\nA slightly related issue is the fact that if a team is very inhomogeneous, and\nwe estimate the stories just by their complexity, we can't really predict\nwhether our sprint will be a successful one, because it all depends on which\ndeveloper works on which story. Believe it or not, I happened to complete\nin a handful of hours a story that a teammate had been working on for almost\none month (I assume he was also slacking off, but the point remains): at the\nstandups he was always reporting “good progress”, until I took the chance of\nhim having a day off and I stole the story from him.

This\nis totally true, but that's the subject of another blog\npost.\nRearranging developers in homogeneous teams\nBesides, it should not come as a surprise that developers can have very\ndifferent skills, up to a factor of hundreds, if we take the extremes, and this\ncan be due to very different reasons: a low performance could be due to one\nbeing a junior developer, to personality issues, or just to a congenic lack of\nan analytic mindset.\nIf on one side it makes sense to mix junior and experienced developers in the\nsame team in order to boost the productivity and skills of the junior\ndevelopers, the same does not hold true for good and bad developers: if one\nhasn't acquired the needed coding skills after a couple of years of work\nexperience, it's unlikely that continuing to have this developer work side by\nside with more experienced ones will bring much benefit to him.
