                  "Is the #IndieWeb just blogs/blogging?What if I told you the \"indie web\"^1 is older than \"blog\" or \"weblog\"^2?The IndieWeb, as it says on the homepage^3, also goes beyond blogging^4.And those are just the terms.It should come as no surprise that conceptually:personal sites in general, predated personal sites with reverse-chronologically-ordered dated entries.Good concepts, even if forgotten, tend to be rediscovered & reinvented over time.When I first used the phrase \"indie web\" (two words) in 2010^5, I used it descriptively, an informal shorthand for the \"independent web\". I didn‚Äôt find out about the 1997^1 use of the phrase until many years later.I saw & was a fan of the 2001 launch of the \"Independents Day\" site & its manifesto^6 (at independentsday(.)org, since offline) that asked ‚Äúif you create^7 your own site‚Äù, to join them. That encouragement stuck with me, and was a source of inspiration nine years later.In my presentation^8 at the 2010 Federated Social Web Summit^9, I referenced the \"indie web\" again, and afterwards I proposed to @aaronparecki.com that we start something focused on explicit principles & practices.^10 After subsequent chats & discussions, we settled on the term ‚ÄúIndieWeb‚Äù (one word). We started with three essential principles/practices, in today‚Äôs terms: ‚Äúcreate‚Äù, ‚Äúuse what you make‚Äù, and ‚Äúown your data‚Äù, which the community eventually expanded into 11 principles^11.This brings us back to the original question, is the #IndieWeb just blogs/blogging?In short no. Seemingly paradoxically, blogging is neither required nor sufficient to ‚Äúbe‚Äù IndieWeb as we use the term today.Are IndieWeb sites blogs?Some (perhaps even most) of them are. However, there are plenty of personal sites that are just a homepage^12, or a handful of static pages like a portfolio^13.Are blogs IndieWeb sites?Some of them are, if they are personal blogs, or other forms of independent sites, like small organizations with their own blogs, on their own domains.

                    "value": "Another interesting contrast^1 in the #IndieWeb community is that most of us have both:* a domain name^2 ‚Äî for posting our content, replies, likes etc.* a chat-name^3 ‚Äî for chatting in our discussion channels^4Ideally, we would have a discussion system that ‚Äújust‚Äù used our domain names as identities (IndieAuth^5 for Web sign-in^6) to chat with each other, but no such system exists (yet).No we‚Äôre not going to all setup XMPP servers on our domains and attempt to hook them all up. Nearly no one wants to pay that admintax^7. Nor would XMPP let us ‚Äújust‚Äù use our domain names. Like email, XMPP requires a separate ‚Äúusername‚Äù. Sure we could fake it like Bridgy Fed does for us with 'domain @ domain', but why would we work harder for a worse UX?So instead of making things more complex than domains, we took the opposite approach, and based our chat on IRC, and our chat-names on plain nicknames.Using a chat system like IRC lowered the barrier to participation in the IndieWeb community, so you could for example, ask about how to pick a domain name^2 instead of being stuck in an actual catch-22^1 of needing a domain name just to ask about a domain name.By putting our chat archives on the web^8, we were able to reduce our chat system requirements, provide a simple minimal web app for brief chats, and bridge our IRC channels with multiple other chat systems, like Slack, Matrix, and even Discord^9. This has the significant advantage of much greater chat client choice for community members.However, we did realize that our statements in the chat archives^8 could be more closely tied to our domain identities, including our personal icons^10. Rather than a complex system or new protocol, we just put our flat list of nicknames in templates with images & domains on the wiki^11.Thus our chat archives, despite being based on IRC, show icons for people, and link their chat nicknames to their personal domain names, again striking a pragmatic balance.^1The flexibility of using a wiki template allowed us to add personal time zones as well, to enable things like asking in chat, ‚Äúwhat time is it for tantek‚Äù.

Try eating what you cook on your own website. Rely less on the unhealthy fast food of corporate social media. We use the metaphor Eat What You Cook^2 to more broadly relate to creators^3 of all kinds, the chefs & cooks of the IndieWeb.Cooks often taste their dishes while cooking, and modify them accordingly. Some even prepare entire dishes or meals to try themselves first, before preparing them for others.On the IndieWeb, some of us do the same by first testing our own code changes in production^4 on our personal sites, before publishing them more widely. Sometimes we let our changes simmer on our own sites for a while, before serving our code for others to consume.I myself have been most recently testing in production my at-mention auto-linking updates^5 on my site for over a week now.

                  "Replying to people on the social web used to be ‚Äúsimple‚Äù before #socialMedia, when we used blogs. You would either write:1. a short reply ‚Äî directly on someone‚Äôs blog post comment form, OR2. a longer reply ‚Äî on your own blog, in-reply-to & linking to the other post and send a Pingback, expecting at least the other post‚Äôs author to see your reply, or you would also write a short comment in their blog post comment form with a brief summary & link to your longer reply postAside: web forums^1 at the time were proto-silos^2, and replies/threads were generally self-contained therein.Then social media exploded and eventually everybody was replying everywhere all at once.This was so burdensome that some even hired social media managers to perform the labor of how (and if) to reply on each silo, and attempt to keep up with every new silo that popped up.After a few years of this mid-to-late-2000s social web chaos, in the early 2010s many of us went back to option 2. above from the pre-social-media era, and as part of owning our data^3, started posting our replies in general on our own #IndieWeb sites:1.

Figure out how you want to fit into the network of sites & instances. a png.  We call this POSSE ‚Äî for Publish on your Own Site, then Syndicate Elsewhere.^1By prioritizing your own site, you decide whether (and when) you want to syndicate your posts (or a particular post) to a feed, to a fediverse, to a social media silo or silos, and/or to email like a newsletter.You can make it as simple or as detailed as you want. It‚Äôs up to you.Choose deliberately. Change your mind when things change.¬†You can opt out of any destination, either by not opting-in, i.e. explicitly not sending your posts to them, or blocking them if necessary.Here are a few of the destination decisions I‚Äôve made, and reasons why.You can delay sending a post to an RSS or Atom feed, say 10 minutes after the time of publication, to give yourself a chance to edit your post, fix typos or links, before a classic feed reader retrieves and perhaps caches your post.You can further delay sending to known uneditable destinations, like Twitter or email, to give yourself even longer to make further edits, corrections, updates, or improvements based on feedback to your original post.Some destination decisions may depend on the type of post.When you post a reply to someone else‚Äôs post, in addition to sending a webmention to that other post, it makes sense to also distribute it to where that other post was originally distributed, or a subset thereof, threading your POSSE reply with their original post POSSE copy.https://indieweb.org/reply#POSSE_a_replyFor example, if you reply to someone‚Äôs IndieWeb note, and they‚Äôve POSSEd that note to Twitter, you should POSSE your reply to Twitter as well, threading it with their POSSE copy, if you‚Äôre still using Twitter that is. If they did not POSSE their original note to Twitter, there may be reasons to POSSE your reply to Twitter anyway, if your reply makes sense there on its own.https://indieweb.org/Twitter#POSSE_Replies_to_TwitterSome destinations have content limitations^2, and you may want to take that into consideration when authoring your content, or not.For example, you may want to more carefully copy-edit the first 256 (for now) characters of a note if you plan to POSSE to Twitter, so that the content that makes it through makes sense as an introduction, or a summary, or a hook, and perhaps has discovery features like hashtags. https://indieweb.org/Twitter#POSSE_Notes_to_TwitterYou can use that POSSE tweet text length limitation strategically, placing content after that 256 character cut-off that you may want to edit or expand in an update, or content Twitter may mess-up, like @-domain mentions I described yesterday (day 14).When you publish a multiphoto^3 post, if you‚Äôre POSSEing to Twitter, you may want to re-order your photos to choose which four photos show up in your POSSE tweet, e.g. if you happen to be using Bridgy Publish to cross-post your photos to Twitter. You can always re-order your original multiphoto post after POSSEing it. If you‚Äôre POSSEing photos to Instagram, since you can only do that manually, there‚Äôs no need to edit your original to fit Instagram‚Äôs 10-photo limitation, or 2200 characters caption limit, or 30 hashtags limit, or 20 person-tags limit.https://indieweb.org/multi-photo#How_to_POSSEOr you can reconsider what if anything you get from syndicating to Twitter or Instagram. Are people still seeing and interacting with your posts there? Are your friends?If & when social media algorithms deprioritize your original posts in favor of showing more ads, you can deprioritize posting to social media.If & when your friends quit social media silos^4, you can quit posting copies of your posts to those social media silos.You decide what content goes where, when, why, and can change your decisions any time you want.POSSEing to social media was always a stopgap. As social media silos self-destruct, you can stop syndicating to them.Thanks to Chris Aldrich (https://boffosocko.com/) for the banner image.This is day 15 of #100DaysOfIndieWeb #100Days.‚Üê Day 14: https://tantek.com/2023/014/t4/domain-first-federated-atmention‚Üí Day 16: https://tantek.com/2023/017/t1/socialweb-blogs-reply-comment-post^1 https://indieweb.org/POSSE^2 Day 5: https://tantek.com/2023/005/t3/indieweb-simpler-approach^3 https://indieweb.org/multi-photo^4 https://indieweb.org/silo-quits"

Figure out how you want to fit into the network of sites & instances. a png.  We call this POSSE ‚Äî for Publish on your Own Site, then Syndicate Elsewhere.^1By prioritizing your own site, you decide whether (and when) you want to syndicate your posts (or a particular post) to a feed, to a fediverse, to a social media silo or silos, and/or to email like a newsletter.You can make it as simple or as detailed as you want. It‚Äôs up to you.Choose deliberately. Change your mind when things change.¬†You can opt out of any destination, either by not opting-in, i.e. explicitly not sending your posts to them, or blocking them if necessary.Here are a few of the destination decisions I‚Äôve made, and reasons why.You can delay sending a post to an RSS or Atom feed, say 10 minutes after the time of publication, to give yourself a chance to edit your post, fix typos or links, before a classic feed reader retrieves and perhaps caches your post.You can further delay sending to known uneditable destinations, like Twitter or email, to give yourself even longer to make further edits, corrections, updates, or improvements based on feedback to your original post.Some destination decisions may depend on the type of post.When you post a reply to someone else‚Äôs post, in addition to sending a webmention to that other post, it makes sense to also distribute it to where that other post was originally distributed, or a subset thereof, threading your POSSE reply with their original post POSSE copy.https://indieweb.org/reply#POSSE_a_replyFor example, if you reply to someone‚Äôs IndieWeb note, and they‚Äôve POSSEd that note to Twitter, you should POSSE your reply to Twitter as well, threading it with their POSSE copy, if you‚Äôre still using Twitter that is.
