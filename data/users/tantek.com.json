A few other small search engines indexed rel=tag markup, however none remain today. hReview was adopted by Google which led to it being heavily spammed.This pattern repeated itself with other microformats, and eventually we shifted from:‚Üí of course search is the first obvious use-case‚Üí search is one use-case among others‚Üí we need primary use-cases outside of search for longterm ecosystem successWhich leads to the fourth observation.Four: Publishing alone is not a use-case. There must be multiple consuming code use-cases (beyond search) for a microformat to succeed longterm.From individual features to whole microformats vocabularies, we learned that not only did there need to be sufficient content being published already, without microformats, that could benefit, but there needed to be good enough consuming code use-cases that benefited users (not just developers). The #IndieWeb community has been exceptionally helpful in both defining such use-cases and iterating on them with implementations.We still get questions of the form: What‚Äôs the best way to mark this up?I used to very much believe that if you could mark something up more semantically, you should spend the time & effort to do so. This drove a lot of early experiments with markup, and did provide some eventual benefits, most notably when semantic HTML elements provided good hooks for accessibility tools such as screen readers.Now we know the answer to the question of ‚ÄúHow should I mark-up this content?‚Äù must be accompanied by specific use-cases for consuming code of that markup. If there is no consuming code use-case, it is not worth the time to add the mark-up (never mind the maintenance effort over time).Sometimes one single consuming code use-case is sufficient to justify the time & effort to add more semantic mark-up. If that markup helps screenreaders, then it‚Äôs worth it. More often than not however, there must be multiple (again, beyond search) consuming code use-cases for it to be worth adding semantic markup, and certainly for developing new markup, whether microformats features or new microformats.This focus on and repeated asking of questions like:* What is the (consuming code) use-case? * Or how does it benefit readers of this content?has helped focus our modern microformats efforts on actual benefits to humans first, and machines second (if at all).If you think of IndieWeb use-cases for existing or new microformats, come join us in the developers chat:* https://chat.indieweb.org/devIf you think of other use-cases or want to chat about modern microformats methodologies in general, join us in the microformats chat:* https://chat.indieweb.org/microformatsThis is day 32 of #100DaysOfIndieWeb #100Days‚Üê Day 31: https://tantek.com/2023/044/t1/unified-sent-box-universal-outbox‚Üí üîÆPost glossary:h-card¬†https://microformats.org/wiki/h-cardh-entry¬†https://microformats.org/wiki/h-entryh-event¬†https://microformats.org/wiki/h-eventh-review¬†https://microformats.org/wiki/h-reviewhAtom¬†https://microformats.org/wiki/hatomhCalendar¬†https://microformats.org/wiki/hcalendarhCard¬†https://microformats.org/wiki/hcardhReview¬†https://microformats.org/wiki/hreviewrel-license¬†https://microformats.org/wiki/rel-licenserel-tag¬†https://microformats.org/wiki/rel-tagrel-values¬†https://microformats.org/wiki/existing-rel-valuesXFN¬†https://gmpg.org/xfn/XMDP¬†http://gmpg.org/xmdp/descriptionXOXO¬†https://microformats.org/wiki/xoxoPreviously, previously, previously:* https://tantek.com/2019/044/t1/15-years-ago-introduced-microformats* https://tantek.com/2014/042/t2/ten-years-ago-introduced-microformats-etech* https://tantek.com/2011/042/t2/years-ago-presented-microformats-etech* https://twitter.com/t/status/701095802References:¬π https://tantek.com/presentations/2004etech/realworldsemanticspres.html¬≤ https://tantek.com/log/2004/02.html#d04t1311¬≥ https://gmpg.org/xfn/11#me‚Å¥ https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/profile/#verification‚Åµ https://hachyderm.io/@nova/109790530971147702‚Å∂ https://tantek.com/2023/032/t1/years-relmeauth-replace-openid‚Å∑ https://tantek.com/2012/353/b1/why-html-classes-css-class-selectors‚Å∏ http://microformats.org/wiki/events/2007-12-11-open-media-web"

                    "value": "Nineteen years ago last Saturday, @KevinMarks.com & I introduced¬π #microformats @OReillyMedia ETech 2004, building on ‚Äúsemantic (x)html‚Äù.We‚Äôve come a long way since, from methodologies to #microformats2, from publishing to peer-to-peer #IndieWeb use-cases.We named #microformats only after we had established a pattern of real world examples; even our talk proposal was named RealWorldSemantics¬≤, and provided examples in that broader theme.This exemplified important implicit values in ordering our efforts:1. get real world things working first, not just theory2. name them after a pattern emerges, not just solo efforts3. grow the pattern with proposals, prototypes, iteration, evolutionThe examples at that point in time:* XFN ‚Äî using rel-values for blogroll semantics, and the technology that defined rel=me in v1.1¬≥, now the standard for decentralized social media verification on Mastodon‚Å¥, GitHub‚Åµ, elsewhere, and the basis of RelMeAuth‚Å∂* XMDP ‚Äî XHTML MetaData Profiles, notably using an HTML class‚Å∑ with a particular value 'profile' to indicate presence of a specific semantic structure* XOXO ‚Äî XHTML Outlines, formalizing existing usage of (X)HTML elements for outlines, also using an HTML class with a particular value 'xoxo' to express a semanticGrowing the pattern:* rel=license ‚Äî solved page licensing better than before, since widespread adopted* VoteLinks ‚Äî new rel values, prototyped, only one consuming implementation (since defunct)And further brainstorming:* recommendations ‚Äî initial rel=\"recommendation\" idea eventually evolved to hReview, and today‚Äôs h-review* syndication ‚Äî helped motivate HTML5 <time> element, eventually led to hAtom, and today‚Äôs h-entry* playlists ‚Äî led to various ideas, proposals, & demos‚Å∏, still not really solved todayThe mid-2000s were a time of eager experimentation, when we were learning that very small bits of markup (yes, hence the name) could be used to build some very useful capabilities on top of the open web platform.A few observations with the benefit of years of experience since we proposed ‚Äúmicroformats‚Äù:One: Many microformats succeeded because we solved an existing problem, with existing *complex* solutions, by providing a drastically *simpler* solution.XFN instead of FOAF. rel=license instead of Creative Commons RDF in HTML comments.By doing so, we skipped the often harder problem of defining & refining a problem worth solving, a use-case, or user scenario.Two: A few microformats succeeded because they solved existing problems, re-using *existing established* open solutions in other formats, reformatted into native HTML.hCard from vCard. hCalendar from iCalendar.This methodology leveraged years of prior hard open standards work by numerous others across numerous organizations, and deliberately avoided the bikeshedding trap of renaming things (or any other kind of non-trivial ‚Äúclean-up‚Äù) while reformatting, thus making it easy for developers of one technology to see the 1:1 mapping and use the other.The primary downside with this approach was formats that were larger than perhaps necessary for HTML-specific use-cases.Eventually for microformats2 vocabularies, we adopted a subset approach, looking for web publishing use-cases for each feature, making h-card smaller than hCard, and h-event smaller than hCalendar.Three: Success in a search engine was not enough, and sometimes attracted more bad actors than good. @KevinMarks.com, myself, and others at Technorati built search engine indexing and use of rel-tag and hReview, which helped evolve their specifications. A few other small search engines indexed rel=tag markup, however none remain today. hReview was adopted by Google which led to it being heavily spammed.This pattern repeated itself with other microformats, and eventually we shifted from:‚Üí of course search is the first obvious use-case‚Üí search is one use-case among others‚Üí we need primary use-cases outside of search for longterm ecosystem successWhich leads to the fourth observation.Four: Publishing alone is not a use-case. There must be multiple consuming code use-cases (beyond search) for a microformat to succeed longterm.From individual features to whole microformats vocabularies, we learned that not only did there need to be sufficient content being published already, without microformats, that could benefit, but there needed to be good enough consuming code use-cases that benefited users (not just developers). The #IndieWeb community has been exceptionally helpful in both defining such use-cases and iterating on them with implementations.We still get questions of the form: What‚Äôs the best way to mark this up?I used to very much believe that if you could mark something up more semantically, you should spend the time & effort to do so. This drove a lot of early experiments with markup, and did provide some eventual benefits, most notably when semantic HTML elements provided good hooks for accessibility tools such as screen readers.Now we know the answer to the question of ‚ÄúHow should I mark-up this content?‚Äù must be accompanied by specific use-cases for consuming code of that markup. If there is no consuming code use-case, it is not worth the time to add the mark-up (never mind the maintenance effort over time).Sometimes one single consuming code use-case is sufficient to justify the time & effort to add more semantic mark-up. If that markup helps screenreaders, then it‚Äôs worth it. More often than not however, there must be multiple (again, beyond search) consuming code use-cases for it to be worth adding semantic markup, and certainly for developing new markup, whether microformats features or new microformats.This focus on and repeated asking of questions like:* What is the (consuming code) use-case? * Or how does it benefit readers of this content?has helped focus our modern microformats efforts on actual benefits to humans first, and machines second (if at all).If you think of IndieWeb use-cases for existing or new microformats, come join us in the developers chat:* https://chat.indieweb.org/devIf you think of other use-cases or want to chat about modern microformats methodologies in general, join us in the microformats chat:* https://chat.indieweb.org/microformatsThis is day 32 of #100DaysOfIndieWeb #100Days‚Üê Day 31: https://tantek.com/2023/044/t1/unified-sent-box-universal-outbox‚Üí üîÆPost glossary:h-card¬†https://microformats.org/wiki/h-cardh-entry¬†https://microformats.org/wiki/h-entryh-event¬†https://microformats.org/wiki/h-eventh-review¬†https://microformats.org/wiki/h-reviewhAtom¬†https://microformats.org/wiki/hatomhCalendar¬†https://microformats.org/wiki/hcalendarhCard¬†https://microformats.org/wiki/hcardhReview¬†https://microformats.org/wiki/hreviewrel-license¬†https://microformats.org/wiki/rel-licenserel-tag¬†https://microformats.org/wiki/rel-tagrel-values¬†https://microformats.org/wiki/existing-rel-valuesXFN¬†https://gmpg.org/xfn/XMDP¬†http://gmpg.org/xmdp/descriptionXOXO¬†https://microformats.org/wiki/xoxoPreviously, previously, previously:* https://tantek.com/2019/044/t1/15-years-ago-introduced-microformats* https://tantek.com/2014/042/t2/ten-years-ago-introduced-microformats-etech* https://tantek.com/2011/042/t2/years-ago-presented-microformats-etech* https://twitter.com/t/status/701095802References:¬π https://tantek.com/presentations/2004etech/realworldsemanticspres.html¬≤ https://tantek.com/log/2004/02.html#d04t1311¬≥ https://gmpg.org/xfn/11#me‚Å¥ https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/profile/#verification‚Åµ https://hachyderm.io/@nova/109790530971147702‚Å∂ https://tantek.com/2023/032/t1/years-relmeauth-replace-openid‚Å∑ https://tantek.com/2012/353/b1/why-html-classes-css-class-selectors‚Å∏ http://microformats.org/wiki/events/2007-12-11-open-media-web"

                  "11 days ago I suggested¬π a unified Sent box of everything sent/reacji‚Äôd to all Slacks logged-in with the same email. Beyond Slack though, everything you write & send anywhere: txt, chat, email, web. A Universal Outbox of all content you create, including responses. A flat time ordered list of output across mediums. And a source of material to blog.The phrase ‚ÄúUniversal Outbox‚Äù seemed obvious to describe such a feature, parallel to the idea of a universal inbox that I remember first learning of as a concept from Apple‚Äôs AOCE project¬≤ in the early 1990s, but called a ‚Äúsingle universal mailbox‚Äù.Figuring someone must have come up with the idea, I did a web search, and found a minimal wiki page from 2011:http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki/UniversalOutboxwhich did vaguely describe the idea: ¬†‚Äúa single hub where someone can find all your outbound LifeStreams?‚ÄùExcept I don‚Äôt want ‚Äúwhere someone can‚Äù, but rather ‚Äúwhere I can‚Äù, which is an important distinction, because it would explicitly include things you send to a single person or other limited audience.And yes, ‚Äúcan find‚Äù, with full personal search.Aside: the ‚Äúwhere someone can‚Äù use-case of the presumably more public ‚Äúall your outbound LifeStreams‚Äù is essentially what an #IndieWeb site is for. One place to publish all you want, any way you want, in a composite stream.How many times have you texted, IM‚Äôd, Slacked, or emailed nearly the same thing, maybe to different people, retyped from memory, that you could have searched, and copy & pasted instead?Or how many times have you written similar public posts, replies, or emails, on the same topic, where you said the same thing just slightly differently?What if you could publish such common ideas, concepts, points once, with a permalink, and then cite that permalink rather than retyping the same thing repeatedly?The idea of a Universal Outbox feels like a logical extension of many IndieWeb practices such as owning your data¬≥.While all the things you post on your personal site are a part of your Universal Outbox, they are only a subset. Even if you include everything you can PESOS from other sites, that still leaves services and sites without API access, or with APIs you may not have permission to use.Another approach that may work well is a browser add-on, which would at least be able to collect everything you type into websites.

An add-on could keep track of permalinks to each statement, e.g. each statement in Slack has a permalink (viewable only with login).A modest prototype add-on could start with my initial suggestion, a universal sent box that aggregated everything you said across all Slack instances you use in that browser.

                  "Another interesting contrast¬π in the #IndieWeb community is that most of us have both:* a domain name¬≤ ‚Äî for posting our content, replies, likes etc.* a chat-name¬≥ ‚Äî for chatting in our discussion channels‚Å¥Ideally, we would have a discussion system that ‚Äújust‚Äù used our domain names as identities (IndieAuth‚Åµ for Web sign-in‚Å∂) to chat with each other, but no such system exists (yet).No we‚Äôre not going to all setup XMPP servers on our domains and attempt to hook them all up. Nearly no one wants to pay that admintax‚Å∑. Nor would XMPP let us ‚Äújust‚Äù use our domain names. Like email, XMPP requires a separate ‚Äúusername‚Äù. Sure we could fake it like Bridgy Fed does for us with 'domain @ domain', but why would we work harder for a worse UX?So instead of making things more complex than domains, we took the opposite approach, and based our chat on IRC, and our chat-names on plain nicknames.Using a chat system like IRC lowered the barrier to participation in the IndieWeb community, so you could for example, ask about how to pick a domain name¬≤ instead of being stuck in an actual catch-22¬π of needing a domain name just to ask about a domain name.By putting our chat archives on the web‚Å∏, we were able to reduce our chat system requirements, provide a simple minimal web app for brief chats, and bridge our IRC channels with multiple other chat systems, like Slack, Matrix, and even Discord‚Åπ.

Was their post only published on a #fediverse instance (and/or silo), or was it POSSEd to a fediverse instance (and/or silo) and do you plan to federate (and/or POSSE) your reply¬≥?Then use their @-@ address or silo @-name, or @-@ (silo @-name) for both, or (@-@, silo @-name) parenthetically following their @-domain if (1). This will notify them on that instance (or silo), and may help thread your POSSE reply.When posting a reply, you (or your CMS automatically) should explicitly link with u-in-reply-to markup‚Å¥ to the post your are replying to, and any of its syndicated copy permalinks on destinations you plan to POSSE your reply (see also multi-reply‚Åµ).¬†This is day 18 of #100DaysOfIndieWeb #100Days, written the day after.‚Üê Day 17: https://tantek.com/2023/018/t1/elevate-indieweb-above-silo‚Üí Day 19: https://tantek.com/2023/020/t2/bridgy-fed-follow-form¬π https://tantek.com/2023/017/t1/socialweb-blogs-reply-comment-post¬≤ https://tantek.com/2023/011/t1/indieweb-evolving-at-mention¬≥ https://tantek.com/2023/015/t1/publish-indieweb-decide-distribute‚Å¥ https://indieweb.org/in-reply-to‚Åµ https://indieweb.org/multiple-reply"

(and how can our tools write or pre-fill that for us?)Regarding the latter, on day 14 I wrote a bit about how should we @-mention in general https://tantek.com/2023/014/t4/domain-first-federated-atmention though that was more of a general @-mention exploration. As a follow-up to day 14, it‚Äôs worth looking into @-reply mentions in particular, specifically for each of the above 1,2,3 contexts, analyzing examples of each, and looking for patterns of @-reply mentions best practices that we can document & recommend.This is day 16 of #100DaysOfIndieWeb #100Days, except I didn‚Äôt finish writing it (mostly) til the morning after, and editing later that afternoon.‚Üê Day 15: https://tantek.com/2023/015/t1/publish-indieweb-decide-distribute‚Üí Day 17: https://tantek.com/2023/018/t1/elevate-indieweb-above-silo¬π https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_forum¬≤ https://indieweb.org/silo¬≥ https://indieweb.org/own_your_data‚Å¥ https://tantek.com/2023/012/t1/six-years-webmention-w3c‚Åµ https://indieweb.org/GitHub#POSSE_to_GitHub‚Å∂ https://tantek.com/2023/015/t1/publish-indieweb-decide-distribute‚Å∑ https://indieweb.org/site-deaths"

                    "value": "Replying to people on the social web used to be ‚Äúsimple‚Äù before #socialMedia, when we used blogs. You would either write:1. a short reply ‚Äî directly on someone‚Äôs blog post comment form, OR2. a longer reply ‚Äî on your own blog, in-reply-to & linking to the other post and send a Pingback, expecting at least the other post‚Äôs author to see your reply, or you would also write a short comment in their blog post comment form with a brief summary & link to your longer reply postAside: web forums¬π at the time were proto-silos¬≤, and replies/threads were generally self-contained therein.Then social media exploded and eventually everybody was replying everywhere all at once.This was so burdensome that some even hired social media managers to perform the labor of how (and if) to reply on each silo, and attempt to keep up with every new silo that popped up.After a few years of this mid-to-late-2000s social web chaos, in the early 2010s many of us went back to option 2. above from the pre-social-media era, and as part of owning our data¬≥, started posting our replies in general on our own #IndieWeb sites:1. Regardless of brevity or length, we resumed posting peer-to-peer replies on our personal sites (now sent site-to-site with Webmentions‚Å¥), watched destinations retrieve & display our comments, and were pleased that our peer-to-peer comments looked like any other comments (except with permalinks back to our originals).2. We also started posting replies to tweets, GitHub issues‚Åµ, etc. on our own sites, and automatically POSSE-threading them into their sites of origin.3. When we wrote site-to-site replies where the original post had itself been syndicated to social media‚Å∂, we did both 1 & 2.

As a follow-up to day 14, it‚Äôs worth looking into @-reply mentions in particular, specifically for each of the above 1,2,3 contexts, analyzing examples of each, and looking for patterns of @-reply mentions best practices that we can document & recommend.This is day 16 of #100DaysOfIndieWeb #100Days, except I didn‚Äôt finish writing it (mostly) til the morning after, and editing later that afternoon.‚Üê Day 15: https://tantek.com/2023/015/t1/publish-indieweb-decide-distribute‚Üí Day 17: https://tantek.com/2023/018/t1/elevate-indieweb-above-silo¬π https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_forum¬≤ https://indieweb.org/silo¬≥ https://indieweb.org/own_your_data‚Å¥ https://tantek.com/2023/012/t1/six-years-webmention-w3c‚Åµ https://indieweb.org/GitHub#POSSE_to_GitHub‚Å∂ https://tantek.com/2023/015/t1/publish-indieweb-decide-distribute‚Å∑ https://indieweb.org/site-deaths"
