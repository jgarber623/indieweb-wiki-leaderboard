This let readers follow the conversation in either place, providing an #IndieWeb record for if/when the social media thread was taken down, or disappeared along with another silo shutdown^7.Following this 1,2,3 approach helped conceptually simplify replying on the social web, and worked well except for a couple of interesting ongoing challenges:* What is the most efficient user interface path from viewing someone else‚Äôs post to writing a reply from your own site?* How should you @-mention someone you are replying to? (and how can our tools write or pre-fill that for us?)Regarding the latter, on day 14 I wrote a bit about how should we @-mention in general https://tantek.com/2023/014/t4/domain-first-federated-atmention though that was more of a general @-mention exploration. As a follow-up to day 14, it‚Äôs worth looking into @-reply mentions in particular, specifically for each of the above 1,2,3 contexts, analyzing examples of each, and looking for patterns of @-reply mentions best practices that we can document & recommend.This is day 16 of #100DaysOfIndieWeb #100Days, except I didn‚Äôt finish writing it (mostly) til the morning after, and editing later that afternoon.‚Üê Day 15: https://tantek.com/2023/015/t1/publish-indieweb-decide-distribute‚Üí Day 17: https://tantek.com/2023/018/t1/elevate-indieweb-above-silo^1 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_forum^2 https://indieweb.org/silo^3 https://indieweb.org/own_your_data^4 https://tantek.com/2023/012/t1/six-years-webmention-w3c^5 https://indieweb.org/GitHub#POSSE_to_GitHub^6 https://tantek.com/2023/015/t1/publish-indieweb-decide-distribute^7 https://indieweb.org/site-deaths"

Figure out how you want to fit into the network of sites & instances. a png.  We call this POSSE ‚Äî for Publish on your Own Site, then Syndicate Elsewhere.^1By prioritizing your own site, you decide whether (and when) you want to syndicate your posts (or a particular post) to a feed, to a fediverse, to a social media silo or silos, and/or to email like a newsletter.You can make it as simple or as detailed as you want. It‚Äôs up to you.Choose deliberately. Change your mind when things change.¬†You can opt out of any destination, either by not opting-in, i.e. explicitly not sending your posts to them, or blocking them if necessary.Here are a few of the destination decisions I‚Äôve made, and reasons why.You can delay sending a post to an RSS or Atom feed, say 10 minutes after the time of publication, to give yourself a chance to edit your post, fix typos or links, before a classic feed reader retrieves and perhaps caches your post.You can further delay sending to known uneditable destinations, like Twitter or email, to give yourself even longer to make further edits, corrections, updates, or improvements based on feedback to your original post.Some destination decisions may depend on the type of post.When you post a reply to someone else‚Äôs post, in addition to sending a webmention to that other post, it makes sense to also distribute it to where that other post was originally distributed, or a subset thereof, threading your POSSE reply with their original post POSSE copy.https://indieweb.org/reply#POSSE_a_replyFor example, if you reply to someone‚Äôs IndieWeb note, and they‚Äôve POSSEd that note to Twitter, you should POSSE your reply to Twitter as well, threading it with their POSSE copy, if you‚Äôre still using Twitter that is. If they did not POSSE their original note to Twitter, there may be reasons to POSSE your reply to Twitter anyway, if your reply makes sense there on its own.https://indieweb.org/Twitter#POSSE_Replies_to_TwitterSome destinations have content limitations^2, and you may want to take that into consideration when authoring your content, or not.For example, you may want to more carefully copy-edit the first 256 (for now) characters of a note if you plan to POSSE to Twitter, so that the content that makes it through makes sense as an introduction, or a summary, or a hook, and perhaps has discovery features like hashtags. https://indieweb.org/Twitter#POSSE_Notes_to_TwitterYou can use that POSSE tweet text length limitation strategically, placing content after that 256 character cut-off that you may want to edit or expand in an update, or content Twitter may mess-up, like @-domain mentions I described yesterday (day 14).When you publish a multiphoto^3 post, if you‚Äôre POSSEing to Twitter, you may want to re-order your photos to choose which four photos show up in your POSSE tweet, e.g. if you happen to be using Bridgy Publish to cross-post your photos to Twitter. You can always re-order your original multiphoto post after POSSEing it. If you‚Äôre POSSEing photos to Instagram, since you can only do that manually, there‚Äôs no need to edit your original to fit Instagram‚Äôs 10-photo limitation, or 2200 characters caption limit, or 30 hashtags limit, or 20 person-tags limit.https://indieweb.org/multi-photo#How_to_POSSEOr you can reconsider what if anything you get from syndicating to Twitter or Instagram. Are people still seeing and interacting with your posts there? Are your friends?If & when social media algorithms deprioritize your original posts in favor of showing more ads, you can deprioritize posting to social media.If & when your friends quit social media silos^4, you can quit posting copies of your posts to those social media silos.You decide what content goes where, when, why, and can change your decisions any time you want.POSSEing to social media was always a stopgap.

Last year, paid Twitter ‚ÄúBlue‚Äù accounts finally got the ability to edit tweets, sort of: five times within 30 minutes of posting. Too little, too late.* https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/03/twitters-edit-button-is-rolling-out-to-blue-subscribers-in-canada-australia-and-new-zealand/* https://blog.hootsuite.com/can-you-edit-a-tweet/* https://www.pcmag.com/news/twitters-edit-button-is-coming-soon-for-paid-users* https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/06/twitter-edit-tweet-option-united-states/* https://9to5mac.com/2022/10/06/twitter-rolling-out-edit-button/^2 Pingbacks were originally (and for many years) only implemented as one-off cross-blog interactions. One-time, uneditable. Pingbacks (and Trackbacks before them) were notoriously ugly when they showed up on blogs, listed & displayed as a separate thing (never tie presentation to the name of a protocol) with cryptically elided summaries: https://indieweb.org/pingback#Poor_display. Over 10 years after Pingback was specified (2002), the then nascent (founded 2011) IndieWeb community re-used pingbacks for actual comments across sites in 2013: https://tantek.com/2013/113/b1/first-federated-indieweb-comment-thread separating presentation & UI from the protocol. This separation of concerns approach evolved into the Webmention specification, separating the protocol from the display of comments, likes, reposts, and other social web https://indieweb.org/responses."
