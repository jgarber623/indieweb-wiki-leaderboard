First #turkeyTrot in a while that I ran/jogged/walked. #turkeyTrot2022 Arrived early like last year for a warm-up. Alternated run/walk sessions for ~10min then jogged back to the track start area. Got my bib, pinned it on, used the bathroom, and kept warming up with back/forth strides next to the track. Saw niece & nephew2 start in wave 1, kept warming up. Decided to start with my dad in wave 3.Had to use the bathroom one more time, and by the time I got out, wave 3 was already off. Got stuck waiting in wave 4 (walkers & strollers). Made my way to the start then ran without pacing myself to catch my dad. Found him and decided that I‚Äôd rather stay with him and keep him company. Ran/jogged/walked the rest of the race, eventually returning to the high school track.

First #turkeyTrot in a while that I ran/jogged/walked. #turkeyTrot2022 Arrived early like last year for a warm-up. Alternated run/walk sessions for ~10min then jogged back to the track start area. Got my bib, pinned it on, used the bathroom, and kept warming up with back/forth strides next to the track. Saw niece & nephew2 start in wave 1, kept warming up. Decided to start with my dad in wave 3.Had to use the bathroom one more time, and by the time I got out, wave 3 was already off. Got stuck waiting in wave 4 (walkers & strollers). Made my way to the start then ran without pacing myself to catch my dad. Found him and decided that I‚Äôd rather stay with him and keep him company.

Trail running shoes, socks, shorts, singlet, water bottle, Suunto watch, Spring Energy gel packets, Picky bars, November Project buffs, ziplock with drop bag supplies, and waist belt arranged orderly on hardwood floor.  About ten trail runners starting a race on a lawn, just in front of a temporary metal arch with logo text for Scena Performance & Skyline 50k, and a large FINISH white text on black background banner across the top, park buildings in the background, and trees behind them.  Tantek crossing the finish line sensor under the FINISH arch in the bright sunshine, smiling & stopping his watch, a volunteer in the foreground holding out a finisher medal, David Tran photographing from the side  Plain white index card with ‚ÄúGO T GO, SKYLINE 50K 2022, WOO HOO !!!‚Äù written on it in black marker.  Tantek standing at an angle on a wide trail in bright sunshine with pine trees behind him, holding his water bottle, leaning forward on his right foot, head turned slightly to face the camera and smile.  Tantek running on a wide smooth dirt trail with plowed rough dirt edges, bits of grass and a tree in the background nearby with many more trees in the distance, a single runner out of focus about 50 meters behind hime.  Tantek fast-walking downhill on an asphalt path in the shade next to some dry grass and trees, a lake peaking thru between their branches.  Tantek running mid-stride, arms swinging, on a lawn between orange cones with a park building and trees behind him.  Trail runners Amanda, David Tran, Tantek, Kristina, Ramona standing side-by-side with arms around each other smiling, in front of the race finish area, the latter three still wearing their bibs and finish medals. 10w ago: 9:29:05 50k PR, hot #trailRace @ScenaPerform #Skyline50kThanks @bryanting @aeables @dtran320 @vivekgowri pics&support, @corrinemalcolm training me back to an ultra start+finish 3y after #ECSCA.#run #trailRun #trailRunning #ultraRunning #trailRunner #ultraRunner #50k #50kTrailRace #50kFinish #50kFinisher #ultraMarathon #2022_219 #20220807 #WorkHardDreamBigDoCoolShit #latergram #nofilterThis was my second ultra race finish, and sixth ultra-distance run. Since last year‚Äôs Rodeo Valley 30k (https://tantek.com/t5E81), I signed-up for seven races, started six, and finished five (including this one). I‚Äôm behind on a year of race posting so for now here‚Äôs a mini-report and story of a 50k in 10 photos.Mini race-report: decent fueling, very good hydration, hottest race I‚Äôve ever run, first time using ice in a neck buff & under my cap, left knee-pain (IT band) struggle in the last 7-8mi, had to fast-walk the last 4mi. Thankful for Vivek Gowri crewing me at the Skyline Gate aid station (17.2mi) making sure I had/got what I needed (no sunburns!), Amanda‚Äôs so thoughtful mini cheer sign (üì∑5) she snuck into my dropbag, and the two of them plus David Tran for running me in the last mile-ish which helped push me to a sub-9h30m time. Thanks also to Bryan Ting for both recommending this race to me and being at so many spots on the course to take race photos. Seeing friends along the way turned a hot & hard race into a fun time.Photos in time order:üì∑2: There‚Äôs a certain calm in the ritual of arranging all your race gear & fuel the night before. This was my second race where I packed a drop bag, with extra water & gels I might need if temperatures rose higher, or I took longer than expected. Having trained with nearly everything in that pile at some point, and run the course trails over a couple of days a few weeks beforehand, I went to bed knowing I was prepared.üì∑3 by Bryan: Knowing I‚Äôd be close to the course limit, I opted for the early start option, an hour before the normal start, just ineligible for any competitive medals. It was dark when we arrived, but you can see how much it lightened up (even with cloud cover) for the 6am early start.üì∑1 by Bryan: I kept a steady pace up to the second aid station, stopping only briefly at mile 4 to use the bathroom at the golf course next to the first aid station which wasn‚Äôt set up yet. Right before the second aid station, Bryan Ting was camped out taking race photos, and captured me focused on my run.üì∑5: From there on it was steady work making it up and down various trails as it warmed up in the first half of the race. Made it up to the Skyline Gate station where Vivek was waiting with my drop bag, and handed me a surprise race sign card that Amanda had made for me.üì∑6 by Vivek: It was 85F+ at Skyline Gate, so I sat for a few minutes and took time to calmly hydrate some more. I grabbed a couple of spare gels from my drop bag, and after Vivek helped me re-apply sunscreen, I stood for a moment before jumping back on the trails.üì∑7 by Bryan: The push up to the last aid station was a tough hike in the open sun. I saw Bryan again taking photos and focused on a steady run-shuffle up the trail.üì∑8 by Vivek: Vivek, David Tran, and Amanda found me on the paved path around Lake Chabot with ~1.5mi to go and captured my determined struggle. Plenty of energy left, I was more annoyed by the pace-limiting knee-pain that started in mile 25 and became too painful to run at mile 28. They chatted with me to keep me distrated, and told me I looked good (amazing how much that helps). I kept a steady fast-walk, gently run-shuffling on the rolling downhills as pictured.üì∑9 by David Tran: Running ahead, David took photos & video of me. With the finish area in sight, I swung my arms and pushed past the knee-pain into a run, first on the remaining asphalt then across the lawn through the orange cones toward the finish.üì∑4 by Bryan: Stopping my watch as I lept over the finish line, eyes on the finisher‚Äôs medal offered by a volunteer. Happiness and relief as I completed my first ultramarathon race since 2019.üì∑10 by Bryan: @ScenaPerform‚Äôs Skyline 50k brought friends & community together like no other race since @TheNorthFaceECS races. A bunch of us 50k finishers recalled our adventures during the race while rehydrating & snacking on Impossible burgers at the finish area picnic. Bryan saw us gathered and we lined up for a group photo which perfectly captured the moment.I‚Äôll be back to run this race again."

Since last year‚Äôs Rodeo Valley 30k (<a class=\"auto-link\" href=\"https://tantek.com/t5E81\">https://tantek.com/t5E81</a>), I signed-up for seven races, started six, and finished five (including this one). I‚Äôm behind on a year of race posting so for now here‚Äôs a mini-report and story of a 50k in 10 photos.<br class=\"auto-break\"><br class=\"auto-break\">Mini race-report: decent fueling, very good hydration, hottest race I‚Äôve ever run, first time using ice in a neck buff &amp; under my cap, left knee-pain (IT band) struggle in the last 7-8mi, had to fast-walk the last 4mi. Thankful for Vivek Gowri crewing me at the Skyline Gate aid station (17.2mi) making sure I had/got what I needed (no sunburns!), Amanda‚Äôs so thoughtful mini cheer sign (üì∑5) she snuck into my dropbag, and the two of them plus David Tran for running me in the last mile-ish which helped push me to a sub-9h30m time. Thanks also to Bryan Ting for both recommending this race to me and being at so many spots on the course to take race photos. Seeing friends along the way turned a hot &amp; hard race into a fun time.<br class=\"auto-break\"><br class=\"auto-break\">Photos in time order:<br class=\"auto-break\"><br class=\"auto-break\">üì∑2: There‚Äôs a certain calm in the ritual of arranging all your race gear &amp; fuel the night before. This was my second race where I packed a drop bag, with extra water &amp; gels I might need if temperatures rose higher, or I took longer than expected. Having trained with nearly everything in that pile at some point, and run the course trails over a couple of days a few weeks beforehand, I went to bed knowing I was prepared.<br class=\"auto-break\"><br class=\"auto-break\">üì∑3 by Bryan: Knowing I‚Äôd be close to the course limit, I opted for the early start option, an hour before the normal start, just ineligible for any competitive medals. It was dark when we arrived, but you can see how much it lightened up (even with cloud cover) for the 6am early start.<br class=\"auto-break\"><br class=\"auto-break\">üì∑1 by Bryan: I kept a steady pace up to the second aid station, stopping only briefly at mile 4 to use the bathroom at the golf course next to the first aid station which wasn‚Äôt set up yet. Right before the second aid station, Bryan Ting was camped out taking race photos, and captured me focused on my run.<br class=\"auto-break\"><br class=\"auto-break\">üì∑5: From there on it was steady work making it up and down various trails as it warmed up in the first half of the race. Made it up to the Skyline Gate station where Vivek was waiting with my drop bag, and handed me a surprise race sign card that Amanda had made for me.<br class=\"auto-break\"><br class=\"auto-break\">üì∑6 by Vivek: It was 85F+ at Skyline Gate, so I sat for a few minutes and took time to calmly hydrate some more. I grabbed a couple of spare gels from my drop bag, and after Vivek helped me re-apply sunscreen, I stood for a moment before jumping back on the trails.<br class=\"auto-break\"><br class=\"auto-break\">üì∑7 by Bryan: The push up to the last aid station was a tough hike in the open sun. I saw Bryan again taking photos and focused on a steady run-shuffle up the trail.<br class=\"auto-break\"><br class=\"auto-break\">üì∑8 by Vivek: Vivek, David Tran, and Amanda found me on the paved path around Lake Chabot with ~1.5mi to go and captured my determined struggle. Plenty of energy left, I was more annoyed by the pace-limiting knee-pain that started in mile 25 and became too painful to run at mile 28. They chatted with me to keep me distrated, and told me I looked good (amazing how much that helps). I kept a steady fast-walk, gently run-shuffling on the rolling downhills as pictured.<br class=\"auto-break\"><br class=\"auto-break\">üì∑9 by David Tran: Running ahead, David took photos &amp; video of me. With the finish area in sight, I swung my arms and pushed past the knee-pain into a run, first on the remaining asphalt then across the lawn through the orange cones toward the finish.<br class=\"auto-break\"><br class=\"auto-break\">üì∑4 by Bryan: Stopping my watch as I lept over the finish line, eyes on the finisher‚Äôs medal offered by a volunteer. Happiness and relief as I completed my first ultramarathon race since 2019.<br class=\"auto-break\"><br class=\"auto-break\">üì∑10 by Bryan: <a class=\"auto-link h-cassis-username\" href=\"https://twitter.com/ScenaPerform\">@ScenaPerform</a>‚Äôs Skyline 50k brought friends &amp; community together like no other race since <a class=\"auto-link h-cassis-username\" href=\"https://twitter.com/TheNorthFaceECS\">@TheNorthFaceECS</a> races.

We determined a few key meeting goals, in particular to help participants:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Avoid/minimize any trolling or fallacy arguments \n(based on <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/wiki/TPAC/2021/Sessions#Environmental_Concerns_and_Sustainability_.28s12y.29_of_Web_Technologies\">experience from 2021</a>)</li>\n<li>Learn who is interested in which sustainability topics &amp; work areas</li>\n<li>Determine clusters of similar, related, and overlapping sustainability topics</li>\n<li>Focus on prioritizing actual sustainability work rather than process mechanics</li>\n<li>Encourage active collaboration in work areas (like a do-ocracy)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nThe session went better than I expected. The small meeting room was packed with ~20 participants, with a few more joining us on Zoom (which thankfully worked without any issues, thanks to the W3C staff for setting that up so all we had to do as chairs was push a button to start the meeting!). \n</p>\n<p>\nI am grateful for everyone‚Äôs participation and more importantly the shared sense of collaboration, teamwork, and frank urgency. \nIt was great to meet &amp; connect in-person, and see everyone on video who took time out of their days across timezones to join us. There was a lot of eagerness in participation, and Nick &amp; I did our best to give everyone who wanted to speak time to contribute (the IRC bot Zakim's two minute speaker timer feature helped).\n</p>\n<p>It was one of the more hopeful meetings I participated in all week. Thanks to \n<a href=\"https://blog.yoav.ws/\" class=\"h-card\">Yoav Weiss</a> \nfor scribing \n<a href=\"https://www.w3.org/2022/09/14-sustainability-minutes.html\">the minutes</a>. \nHere are a few of the highlights. \n</p>\n<h2>Session Introduction</h2>\n<p>\nNick introduced himself and proposed topics of discussion for \n<a href=\"https://www.w3.org/events/meetings/d0d7a1bf-a7b4-4930-bf9e-c66069d9c1f9\">our breakout session</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How we can apply sustainbility to web standards</li>\n<li>Goals we could work on as a community</li>\n<li>Consider metrics to enable other measures to take effect</li>\n<li>Measure the impact of the W3C meetings themselves</li>\n<li>Working mode and how we talk about sustainability in W3C</li>\n<li>Horizontal reviews</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nI introduced myself and my role at Mozilla as one our \n<a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/sustainability-needs-culture-change-introducing-environmental-champions/\">Environmental Champions</a>, \nand noted that it‚Äôs been three years since we had the chance to meet in person at TPAC. Since then many of us who participate at W3C have recognized the urgency of sustainability, especially as underscored by \n<a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/working-groups/\">recent IPCC reports</a>. From the past few years of publications &amp; discussions:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The \n<a href=\"https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/ethical-web-principles-20190530\">earliest published 2019 draft</a>  \nof the \n<a href=\"https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/ethical-web-principles/\">TAG Ethical Web Principles</a> \nstates that \n<a href=\"https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/ethical-web-principles/#sustainable\">The web must be an environmentally sustainable platform</a>\n</li>\n<li>2021 TPAC breakout session on: \n<a href=\"https://www.w3.org/wiki/TPAC/2021/SessionIdeas#Environmental_Concerns_and_Sustainability_.28s12y.29_of_Web_Technologies\">Environmental Concerns and Sustainability (s12y) of Web Technologies</a>\n</li>\n<li>2022 W3C member-only Advisory Committee (<abbr>AC</abbr>) meeting panel on \n<a href=\"https://www.w3.org/2022/04/26-ac-minutes.html#t02\">Sustainability at W3C</a> (W3C Member-only link)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nFor our TPAC 2022 session, I asked that we proceed with the assumption of sustainability as a principle, and that if folks came to argue with that, that they should raise an \n<a href=\"https://github.com/w3ctag/ethical-web-principles/issues\">issue with the TAG</a>, \nnot this meeting.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the  <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/community/sustainability/2022/04/23/call-for-participation-in-sustainability-community-group/\">Call for Participation in the Sustainability Community Group</a>, \nwe highlighted both developing a W3C practice of Sustainability (s12y) Horizontal Review (similar to \n<abbr title=\"accessibility\">a11y</abbr>, \n<abbr title=\"internationlization\">i18n</abbr>, \nprivacy, security) as \n<a href=\"https://www.w3.org/2021/10/19-sustainability-minutes.html#x227\">proposed at TPAC 2021</a>, \nand an overall venue for participants to discuss all aspects of sustainability with respect to web technologies present &amp; future. For our limited meeting time, I asked participants to share how they want to have the biggest impact on sustainability at W3C, with the web in general, and actively prioritize our work accordingly.\n</p>\n\n<h2>Work Areas, Groups, Resources</h2>\n\n<p>\nEveryone took turns introducing themselves and expressing which aspects of sustainability were important to them, noting any particular background or applicable expertise, as well as which other W3C groups they are participating in, as opportunities for liaison and collaboration. Several clusters of interest emerged:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Technologies to reduce energy usage</li>\n<li>W3C meetings and operations</li>\n<li>Measurement</li>\n<li>System Effects</li>\n<li>Horizontal Review</li>\n<li>Principles</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nThe following W3C Groups were noted which are either already working on sustainability related efforts or would be good for collaboration, and except for the TAG, had a group co-chair in the meeting!\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.w3.org/groups/cg/multicast\">Multicast CG</a></li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://www.w3.org/webperf/\">Web Performance WG</a> (WebPerf)</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://www.w3.org/community/sustyweb/\">Sustainable Web Design CG</a> (sustyweb)</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://tag.w3.org/\">Technical Architecture Group</a> (<abbr>TAG</abbr>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nI proposed adding a liaisons section to our \n<a href=\"https://www.w3.org/wiki/Sustainability\">public Sustainability wiki page</a> accordingly explicitly listing these groups and specific items for collaboration.  \nParticipants also shared the following links to additional efforts &amp; resources:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.greeningofstreaming.org/\">https://www.greeningofstreaming.org/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/global-greenhouse-gas-emissions-data\">https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/global-greenhouse-gas-emissions-data</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://escp.eu/news/reduce-your-digital-carbon-footprint-shape-greener-future\">https://escp.eu/news/reduce-your-digital-carbon-footprint-shape-greener-future</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal13\">https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal13</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://context.center/topics/carbon-offsets/\">https://context.center/topics/carbon-offsets/</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Sustainability Work In Public By Default</h2>\n<p>\nNoting that since all our work on sustainability is built on a lot of public work by others, the best chance of our work having an impact is to also do it publicly, I proposed that Sustainability CG work in public by default, as well as sustainability work at W3C in general, and that we send that request to the \n<abbr title=\"Advisory Board\">AB</abbr> to advise W3C accordingly. The proposal was strongly supported with no opposition.\n</p>\n\n<h2>Active Interest From Organizations</h2>\n<p>\nThere were a number of organizations whose representatives indicated that they are committed to making a positive impact on the environment, and would like to work on efforts accordingly in the Sustainability CG, or would at least see if they could contact experts at their organizations to see if any of them were interested in contributing.\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Igalia</li>\n<li>mesur.io</li>\n<li>Mozilla</li>\n<li>Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory</li>\n<li>Washington Post</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Meeting Wrap-up And Next Steps</h2>\n<p>\nWe finished up the meeting with participants signing up to work on each of the work areas (clusters of interest noted above) that they were personally interested in working on. This has been captured on our wiki: \n<a href=\"https://www.w3.org/wiki/Sustainability#Work_Areas\">W3C Wiki: Sustainability Work Areas</a>.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe weekend after the meeting I wrote up an email summary of the meeting &amp; next steps and sent it directly to those who were present at the meeting, encouraging them to \n<a href=\"https://www.w3.org/community/sustainability/join\">Join the Sustainability Community Group</a> (requires a \n<a href=\"https://www.w3.org/accounts/request\">W3C account</a>) \nfor future emails and updates. Nick &amp; I are also on the W3C Community Slack #sustainability channel which I recommended joining. Signup link: \n<a href=\"https://www.w3.org/slack-w3ccommunity-invite\">https://www.w3.org/slack-w3ccommunity-invite</a>\n</p>\n<p>\nNext Steps: we encouraged everyone who signed up for a Work Area to reach out to each other directly and determine their preferred work mode, including in which venue they‚Äôd like to do the work, whether in the Sustainability CG, another CG, or somewhere else. We noted that work on sustainable development &amp; design of web sites in particular should be done directly with the \n<a href=\"https://www.w3.org/community/sustyweb/\">Sustainable Web Design CG (sustyweb)</a>,  ‚Äúa community group dedicated to creating sustainable websites‚Äù.\n</p>\n<p>\nSome possibilities for work modes that Work Area participants can use:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>W3C Community Slack #sustainability channel</li>\n<li>public-sustainability email list of the Sustainability CG</li>\n<li>Our \n<a href=\"https://www.w3.org/wiki/Sustainability\">Sustainability wiki page</a>, \ncreating \"/\" subpages as needed</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nThere is lots of work to do across many different areas for sustainability &amp; the web, and for technology as a whole, which lends itself to small groups working in parallel. Nick &amp; I want to help facilitate those that have the interest, energy, and initiative to do so. We are available to help Work Area participants pick a work mode &amp; venue that will best meet their needs and help them get started on their projects.\n</p>",

We determined a few key meeting goals, in particular to help participants:\n\n\nAvoid/minimize any trolling or fallacy arguments \n(based on experience from 2021)\nLearn who is interested in which sustainability topics & work areas\nDetermine clusters of similar, related, and overlapping sustainability topics\nFocus on prioritizing actual sustainability work rather than process mechanics\nEncourage active collaboration in work areas (like a do-ocracy)\n\n\nThe session went better than I expected. The small meeting room was packed with ~20 participants, with a few more joining us on Zoom (which thankfully worked without any issues, thanks to the W3C staff for setting that up so all we had to do as chairs was push a button to start the meeting!). \n\n\nI am grateful for everyone‚Äôs participation and more importantly the shared sense of collaboration, teamwork, and frank urgency. \nIt was great to meet & connect in-person, and see everyone on video who took time out of their days across timezones to join us. There was a lot of eagerness in participation, and Nick & I did our best to give everyone who wanted to speak time to contribute (the IRC bot Zakim's two minute speaker timer feature helped).\n\nIt was one of the more hopeful meetings I participated in all week. Thanks to \nYoav Weiss \nfor scribing \nthe minutes. \nHere are a few of the highlights. \n\nSession Introduction\n\nNick introduced himself and proposed topics of discussion for \nour breakout session.\n\nHow we can apply sustainbility to web standards\nGoals we could work on as a community\nConsider metrics to enable other measures to take effect\nMeasure the impact of the W3C meetings themselves\nWorking mode and how we talk about sustainability in W3C\nHorizontal reviews\n\n\nI introduced myself and my role at Mozilla as one our \nEnvironmental Champions, \nand noted that it‚Äôs been three years since we had the chance to meet in person at TPAC. Since then many of us who participate at W3C have recognized the urgency of sustainability, especially as underscored by \nrecent IPCC reports. From the past few years of publications & discussions:\n\n\nThe \nearliest published 2019 draft  \nof the \nTAG Ethical Web Principles \nstates that \nThe web must be an environmentally sustainable platform\n\n2021 TPAC breakout session on: \nEnvironmental Concerns and Sustainability (s12y) of Web Technologies\n\n2022 W3C member-only Advisory Committee (AC) meeting panel on \nSustainability at W3C (W3C Member-only link)\n\n\nFor our TPAC 2022 session, I asked that we proceed with the assumption of sustainability as a principle, and that if folks came to argue with that, that they should raise an \nissue with the TAG, \nnot this meeting.\n\n\nIn the  Call for Participation in the Sustainability Community Group, \nwe highlighted both developing a W3C practice of Sustainability (s12y) Horizontal Review (similar to \na11y, \ni18n, \nprivacy, security) as \nproposed at TPAC 2021, \nand an overall venue for participants to discuss all aspects of sustainability with respect to web technologies present & future. For our limited meeting time, I asked participants to share how they want to have the biggest impact on sustainability at W3C, with the web in general, and actively prioritize our work accordingly.\n\n\nWork Areas, Groups, Resources\n\n\nEveryone took turns introducing themselves and expressing which aspects of sustainability were important to them, noting any particular background or applicable expertise, as well as which other W3C groups they are participating in, as opportunities for liaison and collaboration. Several clusters of interest emerged:\n\n\nTechnologies to reduce energy usage\nW3C meetings and operations\nMeasurement\nSystem Effects\nHorizontal Review\nPrinciples\n\n\nThe following W3C Groups were noted which are either already working on sustainability related efforts or would be good for collaboration, and except for the TAG, had a group co-chair in the meeting!\n\n\nMulticast CG\n\nWeb Performance WG (WebPerf)\n\nSustainable Web Design CG (sustyweb)\n\nTechnical Architecture Group (TAG)\n\n\nI proposed adding a liaisons section to our \npublic Sustainability wiki page accordingly explicitly listing these groups and specific items for collaboration.  \nParticipants also shared the following links to additional efforts & resources:\n\n\nhttps://www.greeningofstreaming.org/\nhttps://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/global-greenhouse-gas-emissions-data\nhttps://escp.eu/news/reduce-your-digital-carbon-footprint-shape-greener-future\nhttps://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal13\nhttps://context.center/topics/carbon-offsets/\n\n\nSustainability Work In Public By Default\n\nNoting that since all our work on sustainability is built on a lot of public work by others, the best chance of our work having an impact is to also do it publicly, I proposed that Sustainability CG work in public by default, as well as sustainability work at W3C in general, and that we send that request to the \nAB to advise W3C accordingly. The proposal was strongly supported with no opposition.\n\n\nActive Interest From Organizations\n\nThere were a number of organizations whose representatives indicated that they are committed to making a positive impact on the environment, and would like to work on efforts accordingly in the Sustainability CG, or would at least see if they could contact experts at their organizations to see if any of them were interested in contributing.\n\n\nIgalia\nmesur.io\nMozilla\nLawrence Berkeley National Laboratory\nWashington Post\n\n\nMeeting Wrap-up And Next Steps\n\nWe finished up the meeting with participants signing up to work on each of the work areas (clusters of interest noted above) that they were personally interested in working on. This has been captured on our wiki: \nW3C Wiki: Sustainability Work Areas.\n\n\nThe weekend after the meeting I wrote up an email summary of the meeting & next steps and sent it directly to those who were present at the meeting, encouraging them to \nJoin the Sustainability Community Group (requires a \nW3C account) \nfor future emails and updates. Nick & I are also on the W3C Community Slack #sustainability channel which I recommended joining. Signup link: \nhttps://www.w3.org/slack-w3ccommunity-invite\n\n\nNext Steps: we encouraged everyone who signed up for a Work Area to reach out to each other directly and determine their preferred work mode, including in which venue they‚Äôd like to do the work, whether in the Sustainability CG, another CG, or somewhere else. We noted that work on sustainable development & design of web sites in particular should be done directly with the \nSustainable Web Design CG (sustyweb),  ‚Äúa community group dedicated to creating sustainable websites‚Äù.\n\n\nSome possibilities for work modes that Work Area participants can use:\n\n\nW3C Community Slack #sustainability channel\npublic-sustainability email list of the Sustainability CG\nOur \nSustainability wiki page, \ncreating \"/\" subpages as needed\n\n\nThere is lots of work to do across many different areas for sustainability & the web, and for technology as a whole, which lends itself to small groups working in parallel. Nick & I want to help facilitate those that have the interest, energy, and initiative to do so. We are available to help Work Area participants pick a work mode & venue that will best meet their needs and help them get started on their projects."
