                  "11 days ago I suggested¹ a unified Sent box of everything sent/reacji’d to all Slacks logged-in with the same email. Beyond Slack though, everything you write & send anywhere: txt, chat, email, web. A Universal Outbox of all content you create, including responses. A flat time ordered list of output across mediums. And a source of material to blog.The phrase “Universal Outbox” seemed obvious to describe such a feature, parallel to the idea of a universal inbox that I remember first learning of as a concept from Apple’s AOCE project² in the early 1990s, but called a “single universal mailbox”.Figuring someone must have come up with the idea, I did a web search, and found a minimal wiki page from 2011:http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki/UniversalOutboxwhich did vaguely describe the idea:  “a single hub where someone can find all your outbound LifeStreams?”Except I don’t want “where someone can”, but rather “where I can”, which is an important distinction, because it would explicitly include things you send to a single person or other limited audience.And yes, “can find”, with full personal search.Aside: the “where someone can” use-case of the presumably more public “all your outbound LifeStreams” is essentially what an #IndieWeb site is for. One place to publish all you want, any way you want, in a composite stream.How many times have you texted, IM’d, Slacked, or emailed nearly the same thing, maybe to different people, retyped from memory, that you could have searched, and copy & pasted instead?Or how many times have you written similar public posts, replies, or emails, on the same topic, where you said the same thing just slightly differently?What if you could publish such common ideas, concepts, points once, with a permalink, and then cite that permalink rather than retyping the same thing repeatedly?The idea of a Universal Outbox feels like a logical extension of many IndieWeb practices such as owning your data³.While all the things you post on your personal site are a part of your Universal Outbox, they are only a subset. Even if you include everything you can PESOS from other sites, that still leaves services and sites without API access, or with APIs you may not have permission to use.Another approach that may work well is a browser add-on, which would at least be able to collect everything you type into websites. Such an add-on would be more useful than a keylogger, because a browser add-on would have a much better understanding of and access to the context of where you are entering information. An add-on could keep track of permalinks to each statement, e.g. each statement in Slack has a permalink (viewable only with login).A modest prototype add-on could start with my initial suggestion, a universal sent box that aggregated everything you said across all Slack instances you use in that browser. This would be particularly useful for keeping a personal log of your statements across free Slack instances where everything you say disappears in 90 days.For now, perhaps the manual-until-it-hurts answer is to periodically check the “Drafts & sent” folder in free Slacks (from the bottom upwards, since Slack’s web UI lacks the ability to sort or reverse the order of your Drafts & sent folder), one instance at a time, blogging or otherwise copy/pasting anything you want to cite, save, or remember.This is day 31 of #100DaysOfIndieWeb #100Days← Day 30: https://tantek.com/2023/043/t1/footnotes-unicode-links→ 🔮Post Glossary:composite stream https://indieweb.org/composite_streammanual-until-it-hurts https://indieweb.org/manual_until_it_hurtspermalink https://indieweb.org/permalinkPESOS https://indieweb.org/PESOSreacji https://indieweb.org/reacjiresponses https://indieweb.org/responses ¹ https://chat.indieweb.org/2023-02-02#t1675370124338700² https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Open_Collaboration_Environment³ https://indieweb.org/own_your_data"

                  "In recent posts I’ve used ASCII footnotes like \"^1\" to indicate more information about a subject in a footnote line starting with \"^1\" at the bottom of the post.Both inline refs & footer notes should use Unicode superscripts like '¹' and hyperlink both ways, in contexts that support it.I have heard feedback from the #IndieWeb community that inline ASCII footnotes like \"^1\" are distracting and interrupt the flow of reading, and I can sympathize with that.From an authoring perspective, it’s easier to type \"^2\" than \"²\" so I’d rather keep doing so, and write code to do the conversion.I’m also considering what to change as an author, like instead of footnoting special terms/jargon, I can include them in an mini-glossary at the end of a post, thus only using footnotes for specific points or citations. I won’t include terms that mean exactly the same thing as defined by a literal page of the same name on Wikipedia (e.g. ASCII in this post means https://enwp.org/ASCII).During a run I figured out how my existing CASSIS autolink function could detect both inline footnote references and their expansions, convert them to Unicode, and add local hyperlinks in both directions, given an optional parameter to prefix their fragment IDs.

The one Wikipedia design aspect I disagree with is their use of a hat character '^' at the *start* of a reference note to link back to the inline reference, which look distracting, and in my opinion are too subtle/unobvious. I prefer what I’ve seen on blogs: a small return arrow '⮐' at the *end* of a note to link back to the inline reference, which does a much better job of conveying the meaning of “return to where this was referenced / you were reading.”Lastly, I think it’s ok if POSSE copies of my posts to text-only (non-hyperlinking) destinations keep the ASCII footnote style, because such copies usually (e.g. on Twitter) lack enough space for the expansions, and there is less chance of ASCII footnotes being misunderstood as part of something else on those destinations.

                  "Is the #IndieWeb just blogs/blogging?What if I told you the phrase indie web¹ is older than the word blog or weblog²?The IndieWeb, as it says on the homepage³, also goes beyond blogging⁴.And those are just the terms.It should come as no surprise that conceptually:personal sites in general, predated personal sites with reverse-chronologically-ordered dated entries.Good concepts, even if forgotten, tend to be rediscovered & reinvented over time.When I first used the phrase \"indie web\" (two words) in 2010⁵, I used it descriptively, an informal shorthand for the \"independent web\". I didn’t find out about the 1997¹ use of the phrase until many years later.I saw & was a fan of the 2001 launch of the \"Independents Day\" site & its manifesto⁶ (at independentsday(.)org, since offline) that asked “if you create⁷ your own site”, to join them. That encouragement stuck with me, and was a source of inspiration nine years later.In my presentation⁸ at the 2010 Federated Social Web Summit⁹, I referenced the \"indie web\" again, and afterwards I proposed to @aaronparecki.com that we start something focused on explicit principles & practices.¹⁰ After subsequent chats & discussions, we settled on the term “IndieWeb” (one word). We started with three essential principles/practices, in today’s terms: “create”, “use what you make”, and “own your data”, which the community eventually expanded into 11 principles¹¹.This brings us back to the original question, is the #IndieWeb just blogs/blogging?In short no. Seemingly paradoxically, blogging is neither required nor sufficient to “be” IndieWeb as we use the term today.Are IndieWeb sites blogs?Some (perhaps even most) of them are. However, there are plenty of personal sites that are just a homepage¹², or a handful of static pages like a portfolio¹³.Are blogs IndieWeb sites?Some of them are, if they are personal blogs, or other forms of independent sites, like small organizations with their own blogs, on their own domains. However the concept of the IndieWeb goes far beyond blogging, or any jargon like decentralization or federation.⁴The aforementioned principles¹¹ provide a good foundation for the IndieWeb, and a good contrast from the prevailing project-centric attitudes of the day. The practices described inside each principle, such as owning your data meaning owning your notes¹⁴ as well, start to hint at what it means to do & be IndieWeb today.If you have a blog on your own domain, and yet you post notes as tweets or toots on someone else’s domain, are you “doing” IndieWeb?Such a split practice could be considered a mid-to-late 2000s approach to the “indie web”, but certainly not the 2023 IndieWeb. Since 2010, the IndieWeb evolved & extended far beyond blogs, into many kinds of posts¹⁵ typical in social media (but lacking in blogs), and site-to-site social web interactions¹⁶, like replies that looked like actual comments, rather than awkwardly displayed blog trackbacks/pingbacks.Either way, if you have your own site (whether a blog or not) and create with it, like the 2001 Independents Day encouragement, come join us¹⁷, and we’ll help you get setup to do so much more.This is day 25 of #100DaysOfIndieWeb #100Days← Day 24: https://tantek.com/2023/027/t5/contrast-domain-chat-name→ Day 26: https://tantek.com/2023/032/t1/years-relmeauth-replace-openid¹ 1997-02-01 https://web.archive.org/web/20010805195949/http://www.uzine.net/article63.html² https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog#History³ https://indieweb.org/#Beyond_Blogging_and_Decentralization⁴ https://indieweb.org/different⁵ http://tantek.com/2010/123/t2/blogger-turned-off-ftp-what-indie-web-diso (https://twitter.com/t/status/13329370781)⁶ https://indieweb.org/Independents_Day⁷ https://indieweb.org/creator⁸ https://web.archive.org/web/20100723133231/http://federatedsocialweb.net/wiki/2010-199-tantek-fsws-talk⁹ https://indieweb.org/Federated_Social_Web_Summit#Portland_2010¹⁰ https://indieweb.org/founders#IndieWeb_movement_and_terminology¹¹ https://indieweb.org/principles¹² https://indieweb.org/homepage¹³ https://indieweb.org/portfolio¹⁴ https://tantek.com/2023/001/t1/own-your-notes¹⁵ https://indieweb.org/posts#Types_of_Posts¹⁶ https://indieweb.org/responses¹⁷ https://chat.indieweb.org/"

                    "value": "Is the #IndieWeb just blogs/blogging?What if I told you the phrase indie web¹ is older than the word blog or weblog²?The IndieWeb, as it says on the homepage³, also goes beyond blogging⁴.And those are just the terms.It should come as no surprise that conceptually:personal sites in general, predated personal sites with reverse-chronologically-ordered dated entries.Good concepts, even if forgotten, tend to be rediscovered & reinvented over time.When I first used the phrase \"indie web\" (two words) in 2010⁵, I used it descriptively, an informal shorthand for the \"independent web\". I didn’t find out about the 1997¹ use of the phrase until many years later.I saw & was a fan of the 2001 launch of the \"Independents Day\" site & its manifesto⁶ (at independentsday(.)org, since offline) that asked “if you create⁷ your own site”, to join them. That encouragement stuck with me, and was a source of inspiration nine years later.In my presentation⁸ at the 2010 Federated Social Web Summit⁹, I referenced the \"indie web\" again, and afterwards I proposed to @aaronparecki.com that we start something focused on explicit principles & practices.¹⁰ After subsequent chats & discussions, we settled on the term “IndieWeb” (one word). We started with three essential principles/practices, in today’s terms: “create”, “use what you make”, and “own your data”, which the community eventually expanded into 11 principles¹¹.This brings us back to the original question, is the #IndieWeb just blogs/blogging?In short no. Seemingly paradoxically, blogging is neither required nor sufficient to “be” IndieWeb as we use the term today.Are IndieWeb sites blogs?Some (perhaps even most) of them are. However, there are plenty of personal sites that are just a homepage¹², or a handful of static pages like a portfolio¹³.Are blogs IndieWeb sites?Some of them are, if they are personal blogs, or other forms of independent sites, like small organizations with their own blogs, on their own domains. However the concept of the IndieWeb goes far beyond blogging, or any jargon like decentralization or federation.⁴The aforementioned principles¹¹ provide a good foundation for the IndieWeb, and a good contrast from the prevailing project-centric attitudes of the day. The practices described inside each principle, such as owning your data meaning owning your notes¹⁴ as well, start to hint at what it means to do & be IndieWeb today.If you have a blog on your own domain, and yet you post notes as tweets or toots on someone else’s domain, are you “doing” IndieWeb?Such a split practice could be considered a mid-to-late 2000s approach to the “indie web”, but certainly not the 2023 IndieWeb. Since 2010, the IndieWeb evolved & extended far beyond blogs, into many kinds of posts¹⁵ typical in social media (but lacking in blogs), and site-to-site social web interactions¹⁶, like replies that looked like actual comments, rather than awkwardly displayed blog trackbacks/pingbacks.Either way, if you have your own site (whether a blog or not) and create with it, like the 2001 Independents Day encouragement, come join us¹⁷, and we’ll help you get setup to do so much more.This is day 25 of #100DaysOfIndieWeb #100Days← Day 24: https://tantek.com/2023/027/t5/contrast-domain-chat-name→ Day 26: https://tantek.com/2023/032/t1/years-relmeauth-replace-openid¹ 1997-02-01 https://web.archive.org/web/20010805195949/http://www.uzine.net/article63.html² https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog#History³ https://indieweb.org/#Beyond_Blogging_and_Decentralization⁴ https://indieweb.org/different⁵ http://tantek.com/2010/123/t2/blogger-turned-off-ftp-what-indie-web-diso (https://twitter.com/t/status/13329370781)⁶ https://indieweb.org/Independents_Day⁷ https://indieweb.org/creator⁸ https://web.archive.org/web/20100723133231/http://federatedsocialweb.net/wiki/2010-199-tantek-fsws-talk⁹ https://indieweb.org/Federated_Social_Web_Summit#Portland_2010¹⁰ https://indieweb.org/founders#IndieWeb_movement_and_terminology¹¹ https://indieweb.org/principles¹² https://indieweb.org/homepage¹³ https://indieweb.org/portfolio¹⁴ https://tantek.com/2023/001/t1/own-your-notes¹⁵ https://indieweb.org/posts#Types_of_Posts¹⁶ https://indieweb.org/responses¹⁷ https://chat.indieweb.org/"

                  "Replying to people on the social web used to be “simple” before #socialMedia, when we used blogs. You would either write:1. a short reply — directly on someone’s blog post comment form, OR2. a longer reply — on your own blog, in-reply-to & linking to the other post and send a Pingback, expecting at least the other post’s author to see your reply, or you would also write a short comment in their blog post comment form with a brief summary & link to your longer reply postAside: web forums¹ at the time were proto-silos², and replies/threads were generally self-contained therein.Then social media exploded and eventually everybody was replying everywhere all at once.This was so burdensome that some even hired social media managers to perform the labor of how (and if) to reply on each silo, and attempt to keep up with every new silo that popped up.After a few years of this mid-to-late-2000s social web chaos, in the early 2010s many of us went back to option 2. above from the pre-social-media era, and as part of owning our data³, started posting our replies in general on our own #IndieWeb sites:1. Regardless of brevity or length, we resumed posting peer-to-peer replies on our personal sites (now sent site-to-site with Webmentions⁴), watched destinations retrieve & display our comments, and were pleased that our peer-to-peer comments looked like any other comments (except with permalinks back to our originals).2. We also started posting replies to tweets, GitHub issues⁵, etc. on our own sites, and automatically POSSE-threading them into their sites of origin.3. When we wrote site-to-site replies where the original post had itself been syndicated to social media⁶, we did both 1 & 2. This let readers follow the conversation in either place, providing an #IndieWeb record for if/when the social media thread was taken down, or disappeared along with another silo shutdown⁷.Following this 1,2,3 approach helped conceptually simplify replying on the social web, and worked well except for a couple of interesting ongoing challenges:* What is the most efficient user interface path from viewing someone else’s post to writing a reply from your own site?* How should you @-mention someone you are replying to? (and how can our tools write or pre-fill that for us?)Regarding the latter, on day 14 I wrote a bit about how should we @-mention in general https://tantek.com/2023/014/t4/domain-first-federated-atmention though that was more of a general @-mention exploration. As a follow-up to day 14, it’s worth looking into @-reply mentions in particular, specifically for each of the above 1,2,3 contexts, analyzing examples of each, and looking for patterns of @-reply mentions best practices that we can document & recommend.This is day 16 of #100DaysOfIndieWeb #100Days, except I didn’t finish writing it (mostly) til the morning after, and editing later that afternoon.← Day 15: https://tantek.com/2023/015/t1/publish-indieweb-decide-distribute→ Day 17: https://tantek.com/2023/018/t1/elevate-indieweb-above-silo¹ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_forum² https://indieweb.org/silo³ https://indieweb.org/own_your_data⁴ https://tantek.com/2023/012/t1/six-years-webmention-w3c⁵ https://indieweb.org/GitHub#POSSE_to_GitHub⁶ https://tantek.com/2023/015/t1/publish-indieweb-decide-distribute⁷ https://indieweb.org/site-deaths"

Figure out how you want to fit into the network of sites & instances. a png.  We call this POSSE — for Publish on your Own Site, then Syndicate Elsewhere.¹By prioritizing your own site, you decide whether (and when) you want to syndicate your posts (or a particular post) to a feed, to a fediverse, to a social media silo or silos, and/or to email like a newsletter.You can make it as simple or as detailed as you want. It’s up to you.Choose deliberately. Change your mind when things change. You can opt out of any destination, either by not opting-in, i.e. explicitly not sending your posts to them, or blocking them if necessary.Here are a few of the destination decisions I’ve made, and reasons why.You can delay sending a post to an RSS or Atom feed, say 10 minutes after the time of publication, to give yourself a chance to edit your post, fix typos or links, before a classic feed reader retrieves and perhaps caches your post.You can further delay sending to known uneditable destinations, like Twitter or email, to give yourself even longer to make further edits, corrections, updates, or improvements based on feedback to your original post.Some destination decisions may depend on the type of post.When you post a reply to someone else’s post, in addition to sending a webmention to that other post, it makes sense to also distribute it to where that other post was originally distributed, or a subset thereof, threading your POSSE reply with their original post POSSE copy.https://indieweb.org/reply#POSSE_a_replyFor example, if you reply to someone’s IndieWeb note, and they’ve POSSEd that note to Twitter, you should POSSE your reply to Twitter as well, threading it with their POSSE copy, if you’re still using Twitter that is. If they did not POSSE their original note to Twitter, there may be reasons to POSSE your reply to Twitter anyway, if your reply makes sense there on its own.https://indieweb.org/Twitter#POSSE_Replies_to_TwitterSome destinations have content limitations², and you may want to take that into consideration when authoring your content, or not.For example, you may want to more carefully copy-edit the first 256 (for now) characters of a note if you plan to POSSE to Twitter, so that the content that makes it through makes sense as an introduction, or a summary, or a hook, and perhaps has discovery features like hashtags. https://indieweb.org/Twitter#POSSE_Notes_to_TwitterYou can use that POSSE tweet text length limitation strategically, placing content after that 256 character cut-off that you may want to edit or expand in an update, or content Twitter may mess-up, like @-domain mentions I described yesterday (day 14).When you publish a multiphoto³ post, if you’re POSSEing to Twitter, you may want to re-order your photos to choose which four photos show up in your POSSE tweet, e.g. if you happen to be using Bridgy Publish to cross-post your photos to Twitter. You can always re-order your original multiphoto post after POSSEing it. If you’re POSSEing photos to Instagram, since you can only do that manually, there’s no need to edit your original to fit Instagram’s 10-photo limitation, or 2200 characters caption limit, or 30 hashtags limit, or 20 person-tags limit.https://indieweb.org/multi-photo#How_to_POSSEOr you can reconsider what if anything you get from syndicating to Twitter or Instagram. Are people still seeing and interacting with your posts there? Are your friends?If & when social media algorithms deprioritize your original posts in favor of showing more ads, you can deprioritize posting to social media.If & when your friends quit social media silos⁴, you can quit posting copies of your posts to those social media silos.You decide what content goes where, when, why, and can change your decisions any time you want.POSSEing to social media was always a stopgap. As social media silos self-destruct, you can stop syndicating to them.Thanks to Chris Aldrich (https://boffosocko.com/) for the banner image.This is day 15 of #100DaysOfIndieWeb #100Days.← Day 14: https://tantek.com/2023/014/t4/domain-first-federated-atmention→ Day 16: https://tantek.com/2023/017/t1/socialweb-blogs-reply-comment-post¹ https://indieweb.org/POSSE² Day 5: https://tantek.com/2023/005/t3/indieweb-simpler-approach³ https://indieweb.org/multi-photo⁴ https://indieweb.org/silo-quits"

Figure out how you want to fit into the network of sites & instances. a png.  We call this POSSE — for Publish on your Own Site, then Syndicate Elsewhere.¹By prioritizing your own site, you decide whether (and when) you want to syndicate your posts (or a particular post) to a feed, to a fediverse, to a social media silo or silos, and/or to email like a newsletter.You can make it as simple or as detailed as you want. It’s up to you.Choose deliberately. Change your mind when things change. You can opt out of any destination, either by not opting-in, i.e. explicitly not sending your posts to them, or blocking them if necessary.Here are a few of the destination decisions I’ve made, and reasons why.You can delay sending a post to an RSS or Atom feed, say 10 minutes after the time of publication, to give yourself a chance to edit your post, fix typos or links, before a classic feed reader retrieves and perhaps caches your post.You can further delay sending to known uneditable destinations, like Twitter or email, to give yourself even longer to make further edits, corrections, updates, or improvements based on feedback to your original post.Some destination decisions may depend on the type of post.When you post a reply to someone else’s post, in addition to sending a webmention to that other post, it makes sense to also distribute it to where that other post was originally distributed, or a subset thereof, threading your POSSE reply with their original post POSSE copy.https://indieweb.org/reply#POSSE_a_replyFor example, if you reply to someone’s IndieWeb note, and they’ve POSSEd that note to Twitter, you should POSSE your reply to Twitter as well, threading it with their POSSE copy, if you’re still using Twitter that is.

Extra internet points if they also support @-@ auto-linking.This is day 14 of #100DaysOfIndieWeb #100Days.← Day 13: https://tantek.com/2023/013/t1/indieweb-home-internet→ Day 15: https://tantek.com/2023/015/t1/publish-indieweb-decide-distribute¹ Day 11: https://tantek.com/2023/011/t1/indieweb-evolving-at-mention² I’m curious if StatusNet, OStatus, or OpenMicroBlogging had an explicit syntax for site-to-site @-mentions, whether any of them resembled @-domain, and is there evidence of their earliest @-mention usage (if any) still visible on the web (or Internet Archive) cc: @evanp.me (@evan@prodromou.pub)³ Day 12: https://tantek.com/2023/012/t1/six-years-webmention-w3c⁴ Navigating to Twitter hashtag results left as an exercise to the reader, to provide a deliberate soft barrier to a potential doomscrolling trap."
