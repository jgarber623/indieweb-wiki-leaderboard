Try eating what you cook on your own website. Rely less on the unhealthy fast food of corporate social media. We use the metaphor Eat What You Cook^2 to more broadly relate to creators^3 of all kinds, the chefs & cooks of the IndieWeb.Cooks often taste their dishes while cooking, and modify them accordingly. Some even prepare entire dishes or meals to try themselves first, before preparing them for others.On the IndieWeb, some of us do the same by first testing our own code changes in production^4 on our personal sites, before publishing them more widely. Sometimes we let our changes simmer on our own sites for a while, before serving our code for others to consume.I myself have been most recently testing in production my at-mention auto-linking updates^5 on my site for over a week now. They seem to be working well, and I haven‚Äôt noticed any errors or regressions, so I‚Äôll likely roll at least some of those changes into the CASSIS GitHub repo soon.While testing in production may be a reasonable & good practice for personal sites, it‚Äôs often a bad idea for corporate or critical web sites or services, and there‚Äôs no shortage of such examples.I have been wanting to write about our IndieWeb ‚Äútest in production‚Äù practices for a while, and finally created a separate page on the IndieWeb wiki accordingly^4, organizing content from other pages, and adding examples beyond the IndieWeb as well.Do you write code for your website that you test there in production before sharing it more broadly on GitHub etc.?

Regardless of brevity or length, we resumed posting peer-to-peer replies on our personal sites (now sent site-to-site with Webmentions^4), watched destinations retrieve & display our comments, and were pleased that our peer-to-peer comments looked like any other comments (except with permalinks back to our originals).2. We also started posting replies to tweets, GitHub issues^5, etc. on our own sites, and automatically POSSE-threading them into their sites of origin.3. When we wrote site-to-site replies where the original post had itself been syndicated to social media^6, we did both 1 & 2. This let readers follow the conversation in either place, providing an #IndieWeb record for if/when the social media thread was taken down, or disappeared along with another silo shutdown^7.Following this 1,2,3 approach helped conceptually simplify replying on the social web, and worked well except for a couple of interesting ongoing challenges:* What is the most efficient user interface path from viewing someone else‚Äôs post to writing a reply from your own site?* How should you @-mention someone you are replying to?

Figure out how you want to fit into the network of sites & instances. a png.  We call this POSSE ‚Äî for Publish on your Own Site, then Syndicate Elsewhere.^1By prioritizing your own site, you decide whether (and when) you want to syndicate your posts (or a particular post) to a feed, to a fediverse, to a social media silo or silos, and/or to email like a newsletter.You can make it as simple or as detailed as you want. It‚Äôs up to you.Choose deliberately. Change your mind when things change.¬†You can opt out of any destination, either by not opting-in, i.e. explicitly not sending your posts to them, or blocking them if necessary.Here are a few of the destination decisions I‚Äôve made, and reasons why.You can delay sending a post to an RSS or Atom feed, say 10 minutes after the time of publication, to give yourself a chance to edit your post, fix typos or links, before a classic feed reader retrieves and perhaps caches your post.You can further delay sending to known uneditable destinations, like Twitter or email, to give yourself even longer to make further edits, corrections, updates, or improvements based on feedback to your original post.Some destination decisions may depend on the type of post.When you post a reply to someone else‚Äôs post, in addition to sending a webmention to that other post, it makes sense to also distribute it to where that other post was originally distributed, or a subset thereof, threading your POSSE reply with their original post POSSE copy.https://indieweb.org/reply#POSSE_a_replyFor example, if you reply to someone‚Äôs IndieWeb note, and they‚Äôve POSSEd that note to Twitter, you should POSSE your reply to Twitter as well, threading it with their POSSE copy, if you‚Äôre still using Twitter that is. If they did not POSSE their original note to Twitter, there may be reasons to POSSE your reply to Twitter anyway, if your reply makes sense there on its own.https://indieweb.org/Twitter#POSSE_Replies_to_TwitterSome destinations have content limitations^2, and you may want to take that into consideration when authoring your content, or not.For example, you may want to more carefully copy-edit the first 256 (for now) characters of a note if you plan to POSSE to Twitter, so that the content that makes it through makes sense as an introduction, or a summary, or a hook, and perhaps has discovery features like hashtags. https://indieweb.org/Twitter#POSSE_Notes_to_TwitterYou can use that POSSE tweet text length limitation strategically, placing content after that 256 character cut-off that you may want to edit or expand in an update, or content Twitter may mess-up, like @-domain mentions I described yesterday (day 14).When you publish a multiphoto^3 post, if you‚Äôre POSSEing to Twitter, you may want to re-order your photos to choose which four photos show up in your POSSE tweet, e.g. if you happen to be using Bridgy Publish to cross-post your photos to Twitter. You can always re-order your original multiphoto post after POSSEing it. If you‚Äôre POSSEing photos to Instagram, since you can only do that manually, there‚Äôs no need to edit your original to fit Instagram‚Äôs 10-photo limitation, or 2200 characters caption limit, or 30 hashtags limit, or 20 person-tags limit.https://indieweb.org/multi-photo#How_to_POSSEOr you can reconsider what if anything you get from syndicating to Twitter or Instagram. Are people still seeing and interacting with your posts there? Are your friends?If & when social media algorithms deprioritize your original posts in favor of showing more ads, you can deprioritize posting to social media.If & when your friends quit social media silos^4, you can quit posting copies of your posts to those social media silos.You decide what content goes where, when, why, and can change your decisions any time you want.POSSEing to social media was always a stopgap. As social media silos self-destruct, you can stop syndicating to them.Thanks to Chris Aldrich (https://boffosocko.com/) for the banner image.This is day 15 of #100DaysOfIndieWeb #100Days.‚Üê Day 14: https://tantek.com/2023/014/t4/domain-first-federated-atmention‚Üí Day 16: https://tantek.com/2023/017/t1/socialweb-blogs-reply-comment-post^1 https://indieweb.org/POSSE^2 Day 5: https://tantek.com/2023/005/t3/indieweb-simpler-approach^3 https://indieweb.org/multi-photo^4 https://indieweb.org/silo-quits"

Extra internet points if they also support @-@ auto-linking.This is day 14 of #100DaysOfIndieWeb #100Days.‚Üê Day 13: https://tantek.com/2023/013/t1/indieweb-home-internet‚Üí Day 15: https://tantek.com/2023/015/t1/publish-indieweb-decide-distribute^1 Day 11: https://tantek.com/2023/011/t1/indieweb-evolving-at-mention^2 I‚Äôm curious if StatusNet, OStatus, or OpenMicroBlogging had an explicit syntax for site-to-site @-mentions, whether any of them resembled @-domain, and is there evidence of their earliest @-mention usage (if any) still visible on the web (or Internet Archive) cc: @evanp.me (@evan@prodromou.pub)^3 Day 12: https://tantek.com/2023/012/t1/six-years-webmention-w3c^4 Navigating to Twitter hashtag results left as an exercise to the reader, to provide a deliberate soft barrier to a potential doomscrolling trap."

While posting on a personal site has many^1 advantages^2 over only posting to #socialMedia, maybe you already quit social media silos^3.There are lots of reasons to get a domain name^4 and setup your own homepage on the web.If you‚Äôre a web professional, a personal site with your name on it (perhaps also in its domain) can make it easier for potential employers to find you and read your description in your own words.If you‚Äôre a web developer, a personal home page is also an opportunity to demonstrate your craft.^5If you‚Äôre a writer, you can organize your words, essays, and longer form articles in a form that‚Äôs easier for readers to browse, and style them to both be easier to read, and express your style better than any silo.Similarly if you‚Äôre an artist, photographer, or any other kind of content creator.See https://indieweb.org/homepage for more reasons why, and what other kinds of things you can put on your home page.Thanks to Chris Aldrich (https://boffosocko.com/) for the banner image.This is day 13 of #100DaysOfIndieWeb #100Days.‚Üê Day 12: https://tantek.com/2023/012/t1/six-years-webmention-w3c‚Üí Day 14: https://tantek.com/2023/014/t4/domain-first-federated-atmention^1 https://tantek.com/2023/001/t1/own-your-notes^2 https://tantek.com/2023/005/t3/indieweb-simpler-approach^3 https://indieweb.org/silo-quits^4 https://tantek.com/2023/004/t1/choosing-domain-name-indieweb^5 https://indieweb.org/creator"

As a fallback (e.g. for non-@-domain-auto-linking destinations) we can use someone‚Äôs plain domain (explicitly with https:), especially if their home page still has a stream or feed you can follow, or maybe if they don‚Äôt receive homepage Webmentions (yet), e.g.:* https://jacky.wtf/ https://tmichellemoore.com/ https://crowdersoup.com/3. Some folks with personal sites have (for now) created separate Mastodon accounts (or installed an instance on a subdomain), and for them, we can reference their @-@ parenthetically after their domain, like:* https://kevinmarks.com/ (@kevinmarks@xoxo.zone), https://dangillmor.com/ (@dangillmor@mastodon.social), https://simonwillison.net/ (@simon@simonwillison.net) Rather than using social media silo @-names (except when explicitly replying to a silo), I‚Äôm now experimenting with all three of these (1-3) instead, both to elevate people‚Äôs IndieWeb identities, and for Mastodon viewers, provide a convenient way to follow @-@ addresses.If someone‚Äôs homepage receives Webmentions, they will get notified when I @-mention them by domain.I recently implemented syntactic auto-linking of @-@ addresses like this:* @user@example.com --> https://example.com/@userwith a special case for @-domain@-domain to just link to the domain, e.g.:* @tantek.com@tantek.com --> https://tantek.com/I also made a recent policy decision to auto-link all @-@ (and @-domain) mentions to https:, the reasoning being that identities on the web should be using https.* Testing in production here: https://tantek.com/cassis.js, search for \"auto_link(\"Some questions: * Does/do Mastodon (or other ActivityPub servers) notify people when you @-@ mention them in a post? How? Who‚Äôs responsible for that?* Will Bridgy Fed notify the servers (deliver to AP inboxes) of folks I merely @-@ mention (rather than explicit replies, reposts)? Should it?So many people are switching to using their personal domains to post (or at least a Mastodon account) that I no longer feel compelled to @-mention people‚Äôs Twitter handles in posts, which feels refreshing. Now the fun part is experimenting and figuring out what combination of @-domain, plain domain, or @-@ mentions looks good, makes sense to people, and sends notifications to people the way they want to receive them.This is day 11 of #100DaysOfIndieWeb #100Days.‚Üê Day 10: https://tantek.com/2023/010/t2/build-use-services‚Üí Day 12: https://tantek.com/2023/012/t1/six-years-webmention-w3c^1 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT-AT^2 My https://tantek.com/github/cassis/blob/master/cassis.js auto_link() function supports @example.com auto-linking, yours should too.^3 https://tantek.com/2023/004/t1/choosing-domain-name-indieweb"
