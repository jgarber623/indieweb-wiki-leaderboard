Wish granted. On my #IndieWeb site, I control the user experience.Since 2010^1, I‚Äôve had previous/next ( ‚Üê ‚Üí ) temporal^2 navigation links on the top right of my post permalinks, across all posts (something I always wanted on my notes, and Twitter lacked)In 2018^3, I added similar ( ‚Üê ‚Üí ) links on day archive pages, for previous/next days.Ideally I‚Äôd build similar automatic ( ‚Üê ‚Üí ) links for each hashtag in a post, for the previous/next post with that same hashtag.OR for now I could manually add forward-in-time links to the bottom of my five previous #100DaysOfIndieWeb posts, and with each subsequent post, remember to update the previous one.
