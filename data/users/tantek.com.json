Do they have an #IndieWeb domain? Then @-domain mention them^2, like you are speaking to them at their domain identity. This will notify them there, or at least reinforce their domain‚Äôs importance.2.

Figure out how you want to fit into the network of sites & instances. a png.  We call this POSSE ‚Äî for Publish on your Own Site, then Syndicate Elsewhere.^1By prioritizing your own site, you decide whether (and when) you want to syndicate your posts (or a particular post) to a feed, to a fediverse, to a social media silo or silos, and/or to email like a newsletter.You can make it as simple or as detailed as you want. It‚Äôs up to you.Choose deliberately. Change your mind when things change.¬†You can opt out of any destination, either by not opting-in, i.e. explicitly not sending your posts to them, or blocking them if necessary.Here are a few of the destination decisions I‚Äôve made, and reasons why.You can delay sending a post to an RSS or Atom feed, say 10 minutes after the time of publication, to give yourself a chance to edit your post, fix typos or links, before a classic feed reader retrieves and perhaps caches your post.You can further delay sending to known uneditable destinations, like Twitter or email, to give yourself even longer to make further edits, corrections, updates, or improvements based on feedback to your original post.Some destination decisions may depend on the type of post.When you post a reply to someone else‚Äôs post, in addition to sending a webmention to that other post, it makes sense to also distribute it to where that other post was originally distributed, or a subset thereof, threading your POSSE reply with their original post POSSE copy.https://indieweb.org/reply#POSSE_a_replyFor example, if you reply to someone‚Äôs IndieWeb note, and they‚Äôve POSSEd that note to Twitter, you should POSSE your reply to Twitter as well, threading it with their POSSE copy, if you‚Äôre still using Twitter that is. If they did not POSSE their original note to Twitter, there may be reasons to POSSE your reply to Twitter anyway, if your reply makes sense there on its own.https://indieweb.org/Twitter#POSSE_Replies_to_TwitterSome destinations have content limitations^2, and you may want to take that into consideration when authoring your content, or not.For example, you may want to more carefully copy-edit the first 256 (for now) characters of a note if you plan to POSSE to Twitter, so that the content that makes it through makes sense as an introduction, or a summary, or a hook, and perhaps has discovery features like hashtags. https://indieweb.org/Twitter#POSSE_Notes_to_TwitterYou can use that POSSE tweet text length limitation strategically, placing content after that 256 character cut-off that you may want to edit or expand in an update, or content Twitter may mess-up, like @-domain mentions I described yesterday (day 14).When you publish a multiphoto^3 post, if you‚Äôre POSSEing to Twitter, you may want to re-order your photos to choose which four photos show up in your POSSE tweet, e.g. if you happen to be using Bridgy Publish to cross-post your photos to Twitter. You can always re-order your original multiphoto post after POSSEing it. If you‚Äôre POSSEing photos to Instagram, since you can only do that manually, there‚Äôs no need to edit your original to fit Instagram‚Äôs 10-photo limitation, or 2200 characters caption limit, or 30 hashtags limit, or 20 person-tags limit.https://indieweb.org/multi-photo#How_to_POSSEOr you can reconsider what if anything you get from syndicating to Twitter or Instagram.

Workaround: use other @-domain mentions in posts after the POSSE tweet cut-off).I think that was my earliest use because two days after that post I added @-domain auto-linking to the https://tantek.com/github/cassis (@cassisjs) \"auto_link\" function https://github.com/tantek/cassis/commit/0e8e6270c0a3b600423c283f59b5d22c3648d59a (https://twitter.com/cassisjs/status/941107922318381057), likely having already tested it in production on my own site with that post.I‚Äôm still #testingInProduction the updates noted in ^3, notably \"https:\" for all @-mentions (@-name @-domain @-@) and hope to merge them into the repo soon. Aside: both that and the #testInProduction hashtag have hilarious Twitter results^4.Does anyone know of any other auto-linkers that support linking @-domain in plain text to an https URL of that domain?

                  "One of the fun things about #IndieWeb notes & replies is that how we post is actively evolving! Like how should we @ someone?#socialMedia aliases (e.g. @Twitter) were obvious, with prior @-name usage on Flickr etc.Now, some have a domain, or an @-@ (pronounced at-at, yes, just like the abbreviation for Imperial All Terrain Armored Transport^1), or some have both.We can ask questions like why do we @-someone? What are the use-cases?* In a reply to a public post, clearly express that you‚Äôre speaking to that person* In a reply to a reply, that you‚Äôre speaking to everyone upthread (AKA a https://indieweb.org/canoe)* When attributing something to someone (photo/post/cool thing by so-and-so), giving credit* Distinguish a person (or something that can be followed) from ‚Äújust‚Äù a site* For all the above, notifying someone accordinglySome ideas:1. Ideally, if/when everyone has their own domain (where they receive Webmention notifications, and a feed you can follow), we can @-name their domain, which your auto-linker^2 should hyperlink accordingly, e.g.* @aaronparecki.com @anomalily.net @Martymcgui.re‚Äé @david.shanske.com @voxpelli.com @adactio.com @marcthiele.com @mxb.devThese all look close enough to social media aliases/names that they‚Äôre immediately recognizable as readable @-names, a good consideration when choosing a domain name.^32. As a fallback (e.g. for non-@-domain-auto-linking destinations) we can use someone‚Äôs plain domain (explicitly with https:), especially if their home page still has a stream or feed you can follow, or maybe if they don‚Äôt receive homepage Webmentions (yet), e.g.:* https://jacky.wtf/ https://tmichellemoore.com/ https://crowdersoup.com/3.

Last year, paid Twitter ‚ÄúBlue‚Äù accounts finally got the ability to edit tweets, sort of: five times within 30 minutes of posting. Too little, too late.* https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/03/twitters-edit-button-is-rolling-out-to-blue-subscribers-in-canada-australia-and-new-zealand/* https://blog.hootsuite.com/can-you-edit-a-tweet/* https://www.pcmag.com/news/twitters-edit-button-is-coming-soon-for-paid-users* https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/06/twitter-edit-tweet-option-united-states/* https://9to5mac.com/2022/10/06/twitter-rolling-out-edit-button/^2 Pingbacks were originally (and for many years) only implemented as one-off cross-blog interactions. One-time, uneditable. Pingbacks (and Trackbacks before them) were notoriously ugly when they showed up on blogs, listed & displayed as a separate thing (never tie presentation to the name of a protocol) with cryptically elided summaries: https://indieweb.org/pingback#Poor_display. Over 10 years after Pingback was specified (2002), the then nascent (founded 2011) IndieWeb community re-used pingbacks for actual comments across sites in 2013: https://tantek.com/2013/113/b1/first-federated-indieweb-comment-thread separating presentation & UI from the protocol. This separation of concerns approach evolved into the Webmention specification, separating the protocol from the display of comments, likes, reposts, and other social web https://indieweb.org/responses."
