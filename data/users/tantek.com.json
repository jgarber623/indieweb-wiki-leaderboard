Got my bib, pinned it on, used the bathroom, and kept warming up with back/forth strides next to the track. Saw niece & nephew2 start in wave 1, kept warming up. Decided to start with my dad in wave 3.Had to use the bathroom one more time, and by the time I got out, wave 3 was already off. Got stuck waiting in wave 4 (walkers & strollers).

Since last year‚Äôs Rodeo Valley 30k (https://tantek.com/t5E81), I signed-up for seven races, started six, and finished five (including this one). I‚Äôm behind on a year of race posting so for now here‚Äôs a mini-report and story of a 50k in 10 photos.Mini race-report: decent fueling, very good hydration, hottest race I‚Äôve ever run, first time using ice in a neck buff & under my cap, left knee-pain (IT band) struggle in the last 7-8mi, had to fast-walk the last 4mi. Thankful for Vivek Gowri crewing me at the Skyline Gate aid station (17.2mi) making sure I had/got what I needed (no sunburns!), Amanda‚Äôs so thoughtful mini cheer sign (üì∑5) she snuck into my dropbag, and the two of them plus David Tran for running me in the last mile-ish which helped push me to a sub-9h30m time. Thanks also to Bryan Ting for both recommending this race to me and being at so many spots on the course to take race photos. Seeing friends along the way turned a hot & hard race into a fun time.Photos in time order:üì∑2: There‚Äôs a certain calm in the ritual of arranging all your race gear & fuel the night before. This was my second race where I packed a drop bag, with extra water & gels I might need if temperatures rose higher, or I took longer than expected. Having trained with nearly everything in that pile at some point, and run the course trails over a couple of days a few weeks beforehand, I went to bed knowing I was prepared.üì∑3 by Bryan: Knowing I‚Äôd be close to the course limit, I opted for the early start option, an hour before the normal start, just ineligible for any competitive medals. It was dark when we arrived, but you can see how much it lightened up (even with cloud cover) for the 6am early start.üì∑1 by Bryan: I kept a steady pace up to the second aid station, stopping only briefly at mile 4 to use the bathroom at the golf course next to the first aid station which wasn‚Äôt set up yet. Right before the second aid station, Bryan Ting was camped out taking race photos, and captured me focused on my run.üì∑5: From there on it was steady work making it up and down various trails as it warmed up in the first half of the race. Made it up to the Skyline Gate station where Vivek was waiting with my drop bag, and handed me a surprise race sign card that Amanda had made for me.üì∑6 by Vivek: It was 85F+ at Skyline Gate, so I sat for a few minutes and took time to calmly hydrate some more. I grabbed a couple of spare gels from my drop bag, and after Vivek helped me re-apply sunscreen, I stood for a moment before jumping back on the trails.üì∑7 by Bryan: The push up to the last aid station was a tough hike in the open sun. I saw Bryan again taking photos and focused on a steady run-shuffle up the trail.üì∑8 by Vivek: Vivek, David Tran, and Amanda found me on the paved path around Lake Chabot with ~1.5mi to go and captured my determined struggle. Plenty of energy left, I was more annoyed by the pace-limiting knee-pain that started in mile 25 and became too painful to run at mile 28. They chatted with me to keep me distrated, and told me I looked good (amazing how much that helps). I kept a steady fast-walk, gently run-shuffling on the rolling downhills as pictured.üì∑9 by David Tran: Running ahead, David took photos & video of me. With the finish area in sight, I swung my arms and pushed past the knee-pain into a run, first on the remaining asphalt then across the lawn through the orange cones toward the finish.üì∑4 by Bryan: Stopping my watch as I lept over the finish line, eyes on the finisher‚Äôs medal offered by a volunteer. Happiness and relief as I completed my first ultramarathon race since 2019.üì∑10 by Bryan: @ScenaPerform‚Äôs Skyline 50k brought friends & community together like no other race since @TheNorthFaceECS races. A bunch of us 50k finishers recalled our adventures during the race while rehydrating & snacking on Impossible burgers at the finish area picnic. Bryan saw us gathered and we lined up for a group photo which perfectly captured the moment.I‚Äôll be back to run this race again."

Since last year‚Äôs Rodeo Valley 30k (https://tantek.com/t5E81), I signed-up for seven races, started six, and finished five (including this one). I‚Äôm behind on a year of race posting so for now here‚Äôs a mini-report and story of a 50k in 10 photos.Mini race-report: decent fueling, very good hydration, hottest race I‚Äôve ever run, first time using ice in a neck buff & under my cap, left knee-pain (IT band) struggle in the last 7-8mi, had to fast-walk the last 4mi. Thankful for Vivek Gowri crewing me at the Skyline Gate aid station (17.2mi) making sure I had/got what I needed (no sunburns!), Amanda‚Äôs so thoughtful mini cheer sign (üì∑5) she snuck into my dropbag, and the two of them plus David Tran for running me in the last mile-ish which helped push me to a sub-9h30m time. Thanks also to Bryan Ting for both recommending this race to me and being at so many spots on the course to take race photos. Seeing friends along the way turned a hot & hard race into a fun time.Photos in time order:üì∑2: There‚Äôs a certain calm in the ritual of arranging all your race gear & fuel the night before. This was my second race where I packed a drop bag, with extra water & gels I might need if temperatures rose higher, or I took longer than expected. Having trained with nearly everything in that pile at some point, and run the course trails over a couple of days a few weeks beforehand, I went to bed knowing I was prepared.üì∑3 by Bryan: Knowing I‚Äôd be close to the course limit, I opted for the early start option, an hour before the normal start, just ineligible for any competitive medals. It was dark when we arrived, but you can see how much it lightened up (even with cloud cover) for the 6am early start.üì∑1 by Bryan: I kept a steady pace up to the second aid station, stopping only briefly at mile 4 to use the bathroom at the golf course next to the first aid station which wasn‚Äôt set up yet. Right before the second aid station, Bryan Ting was camped out taking race photos, and captured me focused on my run.üì∑5: From there on it was steady work making it up and down various trails as it warmed up in the first half of the race. Made it up to the Skyline Gate station where Vivek was waiting with my drop bag, and handed me a surprise race sign card that Amanda had made for me.üì∑6 by Vivek: It was 85F+ at Skyline Gate, so I sat for a few minutes and took time to calmly hydrate some more. I grabbed a couple of spare gels from my drop bag, and after Vivek helped me re-apply sunscreen, I stood for a moment before jumping back on the trails.üì∑7 by Bryan: The push up to the last aid station was a tough hike in the open sun. I saw Bryan again taking photos and focused on a steady run-shuffle up the trail.üì∑8 by Vivek: Vivek, David Tran, and Amanda found me on the paved path around Lake Chabot with ~1.5mi to go and captured my determined struggle. Plenty of energy left, I was more annoyed by the pace-limiting knee-pain that started in mile 25 and became too painful to run at mile 28. They chatted with me to keep me distrated, and told me I looked good (amazing how much that helps).

Since then many of us who participate at W3C have recognized the urgency of sustainability, especially as underscored by \n<a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/working-groups/\">recent IPCC reports</a>.

For our limited meeting time, I asked participants to share how they want to have the biggest impact on sustainability at W3C, with the web in general, and actively prioritize our work accordingly.\n</p>\n\n<h2>Work Areas, Groups, Resources</h2>\n\n<p>\nEveryone took turns introducing themselves and expressing which aspects of sustainability were important to them, noting any particular background or applicable expertise, as well as which other W3C groups they are participating in, as opportunities for liaison and collaboration. Several clusters of interest emerged:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Technologies to reduce energy usage</li>\n<li>W3C meetings and operations</li>\n<li>Measurement</li>\n<li>System Effects</li>\n<li>Horizontal Review</li>\n<li>Principles</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nThe following W3C Groups were noted which are either already working on sustainability related efforts or would be good for collaboration, and except for the TAG, had a group co-chair in the meeting!\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.w3.org/groups/cg/multicast\">Multicast CG</a></li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://www.w3.org/webperf/\">Web Performance WG</a> (WebPerf)</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://www.w3.org/community/sustyweb/\">Sustainable Web Design CG</a> (sustyweb)</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://tag.w3.org/\">Technical Architecture Group</a> (<abbr>TAG</abbr>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nI proposed adding a liaisons section to our \n<a href=\"https://www.w3.org/wiki/Sustainability\">public Sustainability wiki page</a> accordingly explicitly listing these groups and specific items for collaboration.  \nParticipants also shared the following links to additional efforts &amp; resources:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.greeningofstreaming.org/\">https://www.greeningofstreaming.org/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/global-greenhouse-gas-emissions-data\">https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/global-greenhouse-gas-emissions-data</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://escp.eu/news/reduce-your-digital-carbon-footprint-shape-greener-future\">https://escp.eu/news/reduce-your-digital-carbon-footprint-shape-greener-future</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal13\">https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal13</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://context.center/topics/carbon-offsets/\">https://context.center/topics/carbon-offsets/</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Sustainability Work In Public By Default</h2>\n<p>\nNoting that since all our work on sustainability is built on a lot of public work by others, the best chance of our work having an impact is to also do it publicly, I proposed that Sustainability CG work in public by default, as well as sustainability work at W3C in general, and that we send that request to the \n<abbr title=\"Advisory Board\">AB</abbr> to advise W3C accordingly. The proposal was strongly supported with no opposition.\n</p>\n\n<h2>Active Interest From Organizations</h2>\n<p>\nThere were a number of organizations whose representatives indicated that they are committed to making a positive impact on the environment, and would like to work on efforts accordingly in the Sustainability CG, or would at least see if they could contact experts at their organizations to see if any of them were interested in contributing.\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Igalia</li>\n<li>mesur.io</li>\n<li>Mozilla</li>\n<li>Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory</li>\n<li>Washington Post</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Meeting Wrap-up And Next Steps</h2>\n<p>\nWe finished up the meeting with participants signing up to work on each of the work areas (clusters of interest noted above) that they were personally interested in working on.

                  "I like the direction of simplifying our positions labels, and some degree of harmonizing for better communication.Rephrased from what I shared in some private discussions earlier this week:I think \"support\" may inadvertently convey a stronger meaning than what we intend a lot of the time.
