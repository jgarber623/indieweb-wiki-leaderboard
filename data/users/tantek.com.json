Figure out how you want to fit into the network of sites & instances. a png.  We call this POSSE ‚Äî for Publish on your Own Site, then Syndicate Elsewhere.^1By prioritizing your own site, you decide whether (and when) you want to syndicate your posts (or a particular post) to a feed, to a fediverse, to a social media silo or silos, and/or to email like a newsletter.You can make it as simple or as detailed as you want. It‚Äôs up to you.Choose deliberately. Change your mind when things change.¬†You can opt out of any destination, either by not opting-in, i.e. explicitly not sending your posts to them, or blocking them if necessary.Here are a few of the destination decisions I‚Äôve made, and reasons why.You can delay sending a post to an RSS or Atom feed, say 10 minutes after the time of publication, to give yourself a chance to edit your post, fix typos or links, before a classic feed reader retrieves and perhaps caches your post.You can further delay sending to known uneditable destinations, like Twitter or email, to give yourself even longer to make further edits, corrections, updates, or improvements based on feedback to your original post.Some destination decisions may depend on the type of post.When you post a reply to someone else‚Äôs post, in addition to sending a webmention to that other post, it makes sense to also distribute it to where that other post was originally distributed, or a subset thereof, threading your POSSE reply with their original post POSSE copy.https://indieweb.org/reply#POSSE_a_replyFor example, if you reply to someone‚Äôs IndieWeb note, and they‚Äôve POSSEd that note to Twitter, you should POSSE your reply to Twitter as well, threading it with their POSSE copy, if you‚Äôre still using Twitter that is. If they did not POSSE their original note to Twitter, there may be reasons to POSSE your reply to Twitter anyway, if your reply makes sense there on its own.https://indieweb.org/Twitter#POSSE_Replies_to_TwitterSome destinations have content limitations^2, and you may want to take that into consideration when authoring your content, or not.For example, you may want to more carefully copy-edit the first 256 (for now) characters of a note if you plan to POSSE to Twitter, so that the content that makes it through makes sense as an introduction, or a summary, or a hook, and perhaps has discovery features like hashtags. https://indieweb.org/Twitter#POSSE_Notes_to_TwitterYou can use that POSSE tweet text length limitation strategically, placing content after that 256 character cut-off that you may want to edit or expand in an update, or content Twitter may mess-up, like @-domain mentions I described yesterday (day 14).When you publish a multiphoto^3 post, if you‚Äôre POSSEing to Twitter, you may want to re-order your photos to choose which four photos show up in your POSSE tweet, e.g. if you happen to be using Bridgy Publish to cross-post your photos to Twitter. You can always re-order your original multiphoto post after POSSEing it. If you‚Äôre POSSEing photos to Instagram, since you can only do that manually, there‚Äôs no need to edit your original to fit Instagram‚Äôs 10-photo limitation, or 2200 characters caption limit, or 30 hashtags limit, or 20 person-tags limit.https://indieweb.org/multi-photo#How_to_POSSEOr you can reconsider what if anything you get from syndicating to Twitter or Instagram. Are people still seeing and interacting with your posts there? Are your friends?If & when social media algorithms deprioritize your original posts in favor of showing more ads, you can deprioritize posting to social media.If & when your friends quit social media silos^4, you can quit posting copies of your posts to those social media silos.You decide what content goes where, when, why, and can change your decisions any time you want.POSSEing to social media was always a stopgap. As social media silos self-destruct, you can stop syndicating to them.Thanks to Chris Aldrich (https://boffosocko.com/) for the banner image.This is day 15 of #100DaysOfIndieWeb #100Days.‚Üê Day 14: https://tantek.com/2023/014/t4/domain-first-federated-atmention‚Üí üîÆ^1 https://indieweb.org/POSSE^2 Day 5: https://tantek.com/2023/005/t3/indieweb-simpler-approach^3 https://indieweb.org/multi-photo^4 https://indieweb.org/silo-quits"

We call this POSSE ‚Äî for Publish on your Own Site, then Syndicate Elsewhere.^1By prioritizing your own site, you decide whether (and when) you want to syndicate your posts (or a particular post) to a feed, to a fediverse, to a social media silo or silos, and/or to email like a newsletter.You can make it as simple or as detailed as you want. It‚Äôs up to you.Choose deliberately. Change your mind when things change.¬†You can opt out of any destination, either by not opting-in, i.e. explicitly not sending your posts to them, or blocking them if necessary.Here are a few of the destination decisions I‚Äôve made, and reasons why.You can delay sending a post to an RSS or Atom feed, say 10 minutes after the time of publication, to give yourself a chance to edit your post, fix typos or links, before a classic feed reader retrieves and perhaps caches your post.You can further delay sending to known uneditable destinations, like Twitter or email, to give yourself even longer to make further edits, corrections, updates, or improvements based on feedback to your original post.Some destination decisions may depend on the type of post.When you post a reply to someone else‚Äôs post, in addition to sending a webmention to that other post, it makes sense to also distribute it to where that other post was originally distributed, or a subset thereof, threading your POSSE reply with their original post POSSE copy.https://indieweb.org/reply#POSSE_a_replyFor example, if you reply to someone‚Äôs IndieWeb note, and they‚Äôve POSSEd that note to Twitter, you should POSSE your reply to Twitter as well, threading it with their POSSE copy, if you‚Äôre still using Twitter that is.

How? Who‚Äôs responsible for that?* Will Bridgy Fed notify the servers (deliver to AP inboxes) of folks I merely @-@ mention (rather than explicit replies, reposts)? Should it?So many people are switching to using their personal domains to post (or at least a Mastodon account) that I no longer feel compelled to @-mention people‚Äôs Twitter handles in posts, which feels refreshing. Now the fun part is experimenting and figuring out what combination of @-domain, plain domain, or @-@ mentions looks good, makes sense to people, and sends notifications to people the way they want to receive them.This is day 11 of #100DaysOfIndieWeb #100Days.‚Üê Day 10: https://tantek.com/2023/010/t2/build-use-services‚Üí Day 12: https://tantek.com/2023/012/t1/six-years-webmention-w3c^1 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT-AT^2 My https://tantek.com/github/cassis/blob/master/cassis.js auto_link() function supports @example.com auto-linking, yours should too.^3 https://tantek.com/2023/004/t1/choosing-domain-name-indieweb"

                  "11 years ago today, Ryan Barrett (https://snarfed.org/ @schnarfed) launched Bridgy (https://brid.gy/) to copy #socialmedia replies as comments on original blog posts.This meant those of us building #IndieWeb sites could use a service for that functionality, instead of having to write code ourselves, for each proprietary API.When a few of us originally started syndicating to silos (https://indieweb.org/POSSE), and sometimes reverse-syndicating replies (https://indieweb.org/backfeed), we had to write custom code to do so, calling each social media API (like Twitter) both ways.Bridgy alleviated some of that burden, and over time added support for more silos, sometimes dropping support when they were shutdown (Google+, Buzz) or scuttled their APIs (Facebook).While Bridgy started only with backfeed as a service, it eventually added publishing support, POSSE as a service.Even though I already had code working to POSSE text notes to Twitter, when I added photo posting support to my site, rather than write more code to call Twitter‚Äôs API, I started conditionally using Bridgy Publish to POSSE my photo (and video) posts.In 2017, Ryan launched Bridgy Fed (https://fed.brid.gy) which he has substantially improved in the past few months.I and many others now use Bridgy Fed to broadcast to & interact with Mastodon (and other ActivityPub) servers, without having to write any ActivityPub, Webfinger etc. code ourselves.https://tantek.com/2022/301/t1/twittermigration-bridgyfed-mastodon-indiewebEvery user of Bridgy Fed gets a nice dashboard for notifications and activity.
