              "One of the many things I do with Make is “clean up” a number of tables in various Airtable bases (i.e. remove records which are no longer needed), delete/archive some Google Documents, and similar. This is an automation which I wanted to integrate into a number of other automations, but also to be able to run it in an adhoc fashion.    The solution to this was to use a webhook as the trigger. I can run the Make scenario through any other Make (or IFTTT/Zapier) automation through a simple HTTP request to that webhook. But then I stumbled across another scenario: I wanted to run this automatically the day after I record any podcast. Instead of trying to set up multiple automations involving each of the 4 calendars I use for podcasting (one for each podcast, plus another for any podcasts I guest on), I turned to Pushcut. Every day at midnight Pushcut runs an action which gets my calendars events for the last day filtered to just those for calendars. If there were any events, it calls the webhook to run the tidy up. It’s very simple, 3 actions, but it’s a great way to re-use that same automation as a component. If I need something else tidied up regularly I can add it to that one Make scenario and voilà.     Improving my Label Maker with Keyboard Maestro Mar 14, 2022     Keyboard Maestro   Productivity     One of the things I mentioned in the most recent episode of Automators was how I’ve been fixing small annoyances with automation tools, particularly Keyboard Maestro. I encountered another one with my label maker which I was happy to be able to solve! I have a Brother P-Touch PT710BT label maker. Naming aside, it’s an excellent device—and the Brother software on the Mac allows me to do a mail merge with CSVs—including print a list of labels. Collecting the list and merging that into a CSV is a Shortcuts story for another time, but the thing that annoyed me the most is connecting the label maker to my Mac didn’t automatically open the software. It was just one more step getting in my way. So I fixed it—with Keyboard Maestro.  Continue reading...
