<blockquote>People claim to be Code Ninja or CSS Samurai, but how many of them follow a code? How many of them\n        practice daily katas to keep in the best condition? This book foolishly applies the Seven Virtues of Bushido and\n        the Eighteen Disciplines of Togekure-ry&amp;umacr; ninjutsu to the coding arts, mistakenly finding some wisdom along\n        the way.</blockquote>\n    <p>This book took a long time to write - as you can tell I'm more a coder than a good English… userer…\n        but I really had a drive to put together my collected experience/ thoughts on coding and the misuse of cultural\n        touchstones like Ninja and Samurai. I took about a year of Ninjutsu training when I was <em>much</em> younger\n        and healthier, and I was lucky to have a great sensei and class. After training we'd talk about the culture and\n        backstory. We had the code and the disciplines. Something I feel that coders really need to have. Even moreso\n        now I look at web3 and NFTs and Muskworship.</p>\n    <p>I eat my own dogfood here - I've made a poster of the Bushido code and Togekure-ry&amp;umacr; disciplines as\n        applicable to coding, they're up at glance-level at home and at work. It has actually helped me - re-reading my\n        section on Glory and Honour I started contributing to issues in other people's Git repositories, submitted bugs,\n        worked harder to evangelise developers and testing at work, sharing my skills as much as I could. Heck, even\n        talking more in Twitch.tv streams to help and interact with people came from Respect. Similarly in Disciplines\n        I'm checking libraries more, patching more, taking note of my surroundings. So writing the book distilled my\n        thoughts, reading it again helps reinforce action. If you'd like to buy the book, it's Print On Demand on Lulu.\n        If you'd like to read it first, why not grab a <a href=\"https://vonexplaino.com/blog/media/2022/01/26/CodeOfTheCoderContents.pdf\">PDF\n            version</a> of the book and let me know your thoughts?

How many of them\n        practice daily katas to keep in the best condition? This book foolishly applies the Seven Virtues of Bushido and\n        the Eighteen Disciplines of Togekure-ry&umacr; ninjutsu to the coding arts, mistakenly finding some wisdom along\n        the way.\n    This book took a long time to write - as you can tell I'm more a coder than a good English… userer…\n        but I really had a drive to put together my collected experience/ thoughts on coding and the misuse of cultural\n        touchstones like Ninja and Samurai. I took about a year of Ninjutsu training when I was much younger\n        and healthier, and I was lucky to have a great sensei and class. After training we'd talk about the culture and\n        backstory. We had the code and the disciplines. Something I feel that coders really need to have. Even moreso\n        now I look at web3 and NFTs and Muskworship.\n    I eat my own dogfood here - I've made a poster of the Bushido code and Togekure-ry&umacr; disciplines as\n        applicable to coding, they're up at glance-level at home and at work. It has actually helped me - re-reading my\n        section on Glory and Honour I started contributing to issues in other people's Git repositories, submitted bugs,\n        worked harder to evangelise developers and testing at work, sharing my skills as much as I could. Heck, even\n        talking more in Twitch.tv streams to help and interact with people came from Respect. Similarly in Disciplines\n        I'm checking libraries more, patching more, taking note of my surroundings. So writing the book distilled my\n        thoughts, reading it again helps reinforce action. If you'd like to buy the book, it's Print On Demand on Lulu.\n        If you'd like to read it first, why not grab a PDF\n            version of the book and let me know your thoughts? Or even start with the Code of the Coder Poster.\n\n\n\n     Copperheart \n    \n        COPPERHEART follows the story of one of America's \"Reconstruction Bunkers,\" an enormous underground facility\n            housing thousands of people all working together toward the day they can return to the surface following a\n            global nuclear mishap.\n    \n    I've been following Michael J Rigg's stories for a while, his books Clockwork Looking Glass and Clockwork Pandora\n        are great reads, and the Steam Rollers Adventure Podcast is a great podcast. A call to action from Michael got\n        me to submit some voices for background acting in the SRAPCast. Once he asked for auditions to a new audiodrama\n        I was all in. I didn't get the part I auditioned for... but I got the role of the titular Copperheart itself!\n        Astounding!\n    The first season is done, casting is happening for an inbetween season, and season two is being written. Can't\n        wait to dive back in to more voice acting and this universe.\n    Listen on Libsyn | \n                \n                \n                \n             Subscribe to the feed\n\n\n\n\n\n    ←\n    An IndieWeb Webring 🕸💍\n    →\n\n\n        \n             The Claw Webring \n            The Claw Webring\n            \n                View on GitHub"
