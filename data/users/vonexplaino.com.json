I'm very keen on the Behat implementation of Gherkin for user-testing and am happy to chat about my efforts. I'm also participating as much as I can in the IndieWeb, an excellent initiative for owning your own content.",

I've also got a role in a podcast called \"Copperheart COPPERHeart album cover \", it's scripted by author Michael J Rigg.",
