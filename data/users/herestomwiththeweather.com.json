I gave myself the impression that there was only a 5% chance that I would see a significant result even if the null hypothesis (p=0.635) were true.  However, since there is data for 5 days (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday), I could have performed 5 different tests.  If I chose that same p &lt; 0.635 alternative hypothesis for each, then there would similarly be a 5% chance of a significant result for each test.  The probability that all 5 tests would not be significant would be 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.77.  Therefore, the probability that at least one test would be significant is 1 - 0.77 = 0.23 (the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family-wise_error_rate\">Family-wise error rate</a>) which is much higher than 0.05.  That’s like flipping a coin twice and getting two heads which is not surprising at all.  We should expect such a result even if the null hypothesis is true.  Therefore, there is not a significant result for Tuesday.</p>\n\n<p>I was inspired to write this blog post after watching <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DrSusanOliver1\">Dr. Susan Oliver</a>’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drSAsfuMkuw\">Antivaxxers fooled by P-Hacking and apples to oranges comparisons</a>.
