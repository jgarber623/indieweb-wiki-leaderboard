I was looking for some feedback.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn yesterday's Social Web Incubator Community Group telcon, I brought up the issue of WebFinger.  The current implementations have had some differences in how they are implemented.  Also there are several limitations to it.  Its important to investigate what people are doing and what changes they would be open to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst of all, I would appreciate some feedback about what exactly your project supports, and second I would like to guage interest in implementing some extensions to it.  Anything written to replace it would hopefully still support the existing account structure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, What characters do you allow in User Names on your local system?  What do you allow for federated user accounts.  For example some systems do not let you enter a period in the username, but will accept those that do when federating.  Do you allow foreign characters in your account names?  Emoji?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you allow after the @ sign in remote accounts?  Is it only domains? (your software must be installed at the root domain) subdirs? subdomains (I would assume everyone does, but best to check).  And again, what do you support for federated accounts.  Some systems already allow installs in to subdirectories.  If you do support subdirs, how do you reconcile this with webfinger lookup?  Is it just looking for the .well-know directory inside of that directory?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy current line of thinking is to extend webfinger with a simpler discovery mechanism such as maybe looking up just fetching template at the location given (haven't determined that part yet).  One of the goals of this is to support subdirectory installs and single user domains, or really just plain URLs, but there has to be a mapping between a URL and an account identifier.  This creates a few more questions<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you use @<username> to refer to local users on the system?   If you do this do you allow the period in usernames?  This is particularly important as the current ideal is to allow blank usernames for URLs\r\nso <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ben\">@ben</a>.thatmustbe.me rather than trying to cram some magic word in to the username section.  What would be your level of difficulty with such a system?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you think of extending the domain section to actually be a full url path so <a href=\"https://twitter.com/www\">@www</a>.exampleuniverity.edu/~ben/mysocialapp?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny other feedback or issues you would like to bring up with the functionality and use of webfinger?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThank you in advance for any response you give, all feedback is appreciated.\r\n                                           \r\n      </username>",

Currently it doesn't have a lot of usage, but there is certainly interest in it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Webmention</strong> <a href=\"https://w3.org/TR/webmention/\">https://w3.org/TR/webmention/</a> A much simpler version of linkback, its essentially a method to just notify a specific URL that you have an update for it. Usually this is for letting URLs know of a reply to them. Currently used by indieweb, Known, Micro.blog, and a handful of other implementations. It also has a Salmention extension that is effectively a much simpler implementation of the salmon protocol</p>\n\n<p><strong>Micropub</strong> <a href=\"https://w3.org/TR/micropub/\">https://w3.org/TR/micropub/</a> This is a client to server API, Again, heavily used in the indieweb and some others. It uses microformats vocabulary to post and optionally update and delete, posts.</p>\n\n<p><strong>ActivityPub</strong> <a href=\"https://w3.org/TR/activitypub/\">https://w3.org/TR/activitypub/</a> This is a new spec developed within the working group and getting heavily reviewed within the community group now which does include several projects. It has two parts, both a client to server and server to server part.</p>\n\n<p><strong>WebSub</strong> <a href=\"https://w3.org/TR/websub/\">https://w3.org/TR/websub/</a> This is a cleaned up version of PubSubHubbub 0.4. PuSH was never specified under the W3C so it has been an effort to not break any existing PuSH 0.4 implementation but still provide some clearer specification to it.

Pretty much everyone except diaspora.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Webfinger</strong> this is what sort of led me here today as it seems to be the first place to work on future endeavors. As I understand it there were some issues with needing to rate limit the webfinger endpoint, and many dislike the amount of indirection needed for it. The biggest issue has been getting this to work for the other half of the social world that doesn't use acct:// for user identities. The indieweb uses just URLs for identitiy. So aaron.pk or ben.thatmustbe.me. One option is to add some fake bit to the beginning, like aaronpk<a href=\"https://twitter.com/aaron\">@aaron</a>.pk, or ben.thatmustbe.me<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ben\">@ben</a>.thatmustbe.me. Gets pretty redundant. And then the issue is that a person has two different ways to refer to them, if you telling someone using Known how to refer to you, it has to be your URL, if its someone on Mastodon, its another way. The other issue is that some people don't even have access to the .well-known folder on their server. This can be a huge limitation for them sadly.</p>\n\n<p>So I was hoping to start here.
