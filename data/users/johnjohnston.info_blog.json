Instead, they allowed developing thoughts to be published, ideas shared and shaped, links made to like-minded thinkers, and documents to be written collaboratively – the very values cherished by both luminaries of the Scottish Enlightenment and the creator of the web.</p></blockquote>\n<p>And</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What was missing in 2010 was any sort of directory: a <strong>working record</strong> <a id=\"fnr1-2022-12-23\" href=\"http://johnjohnston.info/blog/#fn1-2022-12-23\"><sup>1</sup></a> of the many flowering blogs, themes and ideas. A “ScotsEdu” wiki would quickly establish this, editable by all, allowing for information to be updated quickly and providing a map for educators, linking ideas, papers and research.</p>\n<p>In short, it would provide a one-stop shop to support an ongoing national discussion about Scottish education.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I saw this article via twitter after a link was tweeted by Ollie Bray.
