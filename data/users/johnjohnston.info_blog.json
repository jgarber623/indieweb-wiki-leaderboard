I couldn’t see instructions, but presumed it would be simple enough to figure out. The second was really simple, but linked to a blog post which had a nice wee pumpkin <a title=\"Micro:bit Pumpkin | For Toffee\" href=\"https://fortoffee.org.uk/2018/10/microbit-pumpkin/\">cardboard template</a> that fitted a micro:bit.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://johnjohnston.info/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/pumkin_ghost.jpg\" alt=\"Pumkin Ghost\" width=\"500\" height=\"506\"></p>\n<p>My class have done a varying amount of coding, so I though we could do this as a stepped challenge. The more experienced could help the other out.</p>\n<p>I printed off the templates and cut out the holes for the micro:bit buttons. I’ve found that making a neat job of these is difficult, but helps keep the cardboard on the micro:bit. Quite glad I’ve got a small class.</p>\n<p>I then worked out and made the code to, add a face to the pumpkin with button A and a ghost with button B. Blowing on the micro:bit would blow (animate) the ghost off the screen.</p>\n<p>I made a quick slide with the challenge and pictures of a few useful blocks.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://johnjohnston.info/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/microbit_halloween_challenge.png\" alt=\"Microbit Halloween Challenge: 1. Show a ghost for pumpkin on button a 2. Show a face on button b 3. Animate face 4. make ghost go away when you blow 5. make ghost only go when it is already on screen 6. play a sound when ghost flies off\" width=\"959\" height=\"538\"></p>\n<p>We started the lesson by being really quiet and watching me demo. The class is 1-2-1 iPads and we use the micro:bit editor, we have enough micro:bits for one each too.</p>\n<p>My though was that the least experienced could manage 1, 2 &amp; 3. I hoped the images of the blocks would remind the others of enough to get them started on the harder ones.</p>\n<p>Most of the class managed the first couple of tasks straightaway. To my surprise quite a few asked to skip the third. The vanishing ghost was too tempting.</p>\n<p>The next step, to animate the ghost away on a sound was managed by quite a few of the class. The tricky part was only showing the animation if the ghost was on the screen. A few, having seen the clues on the slide, created variables to test for at the start of sound block. We did need to stop a few times to figure out when and where to toggle the variable and how to test for it in the right place.

                "value": "The Village of Banton, where I teach, celebrates Halloween on the Friday before the 31. Which is nice ’cause you can have a Friday party. We had one yesterday afternoon, in the morning we did some halloween related work.\nWhen I sat down at my desk yesterday morning I had a quick look at twitter. I’d been in a conversation over breakfast. I ended up having a quick scroll through Mr Morrison‘s timeline. I saw a couple of interesting micro:bits things:\n\nPerfect time to engage in some Halloween coding with @microbit_edu & @makecode! Get Haven the ghost to appear on your micro:bit V2 and then blow him away!! Beware…it is highly addictive and simply great fun!👻 https://t.co/6nzhdswfDY pic.twitter.com/8JCqaWwO3L\n— SSERCdigital (@SSERCDigital) October 26, 2022\n\nand\n\nGrade 4 students coding jack-o-lantern faces with micro:bits in the LLC this week.@StLeoCS @DCDSB_STEM @DurhamCatholic @microbit_edu #halloweenstem\nFound the template here: https://t.co/3dp9wJm1uc pic.twitter.com/tesE0Kk1Yh\n— MrsBintheLC (@MrsBintheLc) October 19, 2022\n\nThe first was to blow away a ghost. I couldn’t see instructions, but presumed it would be simple enough to figure out. The second was really simple, but linked to a blog post which had a nice wee pumpkin cardboard template that fitted a micro:bit.\n Pumkin Ghost \nMy class have done a varying amount of coding, so I though we could do this as a stepped challenge. The more experienced could help the other out.\nI printed off the templates and cut out the holes for the micro:bit buttons. I’ve found that making a neat job of these is difficult, but helps keep the cardboard on the micro:bit. Quite glad I’ve got a small class.\nI then worked out and made the code to, add a face to the pumpkin with button A and a ghost with button B. Blowing on the micro:bit would blow (animate) the ghost off the screen.\nI made a quick slide with the challenge and pictures of a few useful blocks.\n Microbit Halloween Challenge: 1. Show a ghost for pumpkin on button a 2. Show a face on button b 3. Animate face 4. make ghost go away when you blow 5. make ghost only go when it is already on screen 6. play a sound when ghost flies off \nWe started the lesson by being really quiet and watching me demo. The class is 1-2-1 iPads and we use the micro:bit editor, we have enough micro:bits for one each too.\nMy though was that the least experienced could manage 1, 2 & 3. I hoped the images of the blocks would remind the others of enough to get them started on the harder ones.\nMost of the class managed the first couple of tasks straightaway. To my surprise quite a few asked to skip the third. The vanishing ghost was too tempting.\nThe next step, to animate the ghost away on a sound was managed by quite a few of the class. The tricky part was only showing the animation if the ghost was on the screen. A few, having seen the clues on the slide, created variables to test for at the start of sound block. We did need to stop a few times to figure out when and where to toggle the variable and how to test for it in the right place. Lots of useful mistakes were made.\nBy this point a few children had managed to solve the complete problem, adding some sounds to their animation. They could then help, (without using their fingers), their peers.
