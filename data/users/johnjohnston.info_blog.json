                "value": "I listened to VR, the metaverse and education by Edtech Innovators which interviewed my pal Ian Stuart.\nApart for a little dip into Google Expeditions a few years back (eek!) I’ve not really paid much attention to VR.\nOf course I’ve read a lot of tweets from Ian who is now working in the VR field, but not dug in. So I was interested to listen Ian talking on this podcast. It is well worth a listen, a quick 30 minutes.\nI liked the way Ian linked VR to his previous use of technology. Ian insisted that the technology should be developed in response to classroom needs as opposed to the repurposing of business software. Ian had some nice examples of the use of VR and touched upon its use as part of project based learning.\nIan also mentioned an experience from his Islay past, when project based learning needed a fair bit of scaffolding to get off the ground.\nVR does not come naturally to me.
