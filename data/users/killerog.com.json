Dit was dus een raar samenraapsel van oude, juridische, filosofische en nog andere boeken. Het leek me onwaarschijnlijk dat één boekhandel die allemaal zou hebben liggen.

Sheep are for sale on Instagram. If you have an Instagram account, you can slap a price tag on it and take a picture. People are hacking little businesses on platforms they found on the internet.<br>\nIn Thailand there are 10.000 businesses that are only on Facebook.<br>\nFor as long as there has been people, there are ad hoc businesses. It’s easy to add a phone number, or social messaging app account to these sites, but they are also pretty accurate. Some of Them even have tracing numbers posted on their Facebook page.<br>\n83% of the Thai use Facebook.

The largest one is Alibaba’s <a href=\"http://www.tmall.com/\">Tmall</a>. It has 180 million customers, 150.000 merchants, 200.000 brands. Brands are charged an entrance fee – to add a barrier for fraudulent businesses – and a commission for each sale.<br>\nThe merchants get high visibility, high traffic, and a customizable, social media optimized platform.</p>\n<p>There are even businesses that make sites in Tmall as a business. Hosting on Tmall is sometimes better than opening physical stores. Apple opened one last year and now even Amazon has one.<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.taobao.com/\">Taobao</a> is a site like eBay. You pay for advertising to get people to your page.<br>\nYou can buy your trip there for example, but also everything that you might need on the trip, from transport to visa.<br>\nOn Tmall you can get a Peugeot or a Lamborghini.<br>\nBeing on those sites is also a national pastime, like a second job or hobby. These sites have created millions of new jobs.

They are not sites, but platforms.<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.wechat.com/\">Wechat</a> is entirely mobile. It has 500 million daily users. Nobody uses their phone to call, just to Wechat. It has an customizable API, and payment platform. You can make a kind of store inside the app via the API. You can chat with a virtual bot to ask about products they offer.<br>\nThere’s no ‘one web’ over there. In China, and South-East Asia mobile is becoming a selling point. You need light apps, that run on old phones.<br>\nThey are creating mobile only websites. You can see a poster, scan the QR-code, get to a page, and the call-to-action is to go to Wechat. It uses SVG etc. to keep it light-weight. It’s not working very well on desktop, gets stretched-out.<br>\nWhy do they have it there, but not over here? There is almost no penetration in normal financial services.<br>\nFear of counterfeits.<br>\nHow do you know who to trust? There are millions of vendors. They have virtual escrow systems.

You can find Karaoke, educational courses, podcasts, etc. But it has a virtual currency. You can teach things, and people can buy you things for credits. The top karaoke singers make 25.000 a month.<br>\nWechat generates QR-codes for every new account. That’s your identity. You can subscribe by scanning a QR-code. They are using QR-codes to interact, and transact. For example at Starbucks.</p>\n<p>They don’t have the baggage to wear them down.<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.lamoda.ru/\">Lamoda</a> in Russia does e-commerce. But Russia has a problem with poor postal infrastructure. Also they are not trusting credit cards. They tried to send assistants to shoppers. You’re paying at the door, but they bring extra stuff that you might also want to buy and you can try it for 15 minutes and decide if you want it.<br>\nIn China they call it a mobile fitting room.</p>\n<p>In South-Korea they paste a supermarket on the wall, you can scan the QR-code and it gets delivered when you get home.</p>\n<p>Combine drones with Lamoda up-selling? Nobody can predict what happens next.</p>",

The top karaoke singers make 25.000 a month.\nWechat generates QR-codes for every new account. That’s your identity. You can subscribe by scanning a QR-code. They are using QR-codes to interact, and transact. For example at Starbucks.\nThey don’t have the baggage to wear them down.\nLamoda in Russia does e-commerce. But Russia has a problem with poor postal infrastructure. Also they are not trusting credit cards. They tried to send assistants to shoppers. You’re paying at the door, but they bring extra stuff that you might also want to buy and you can try it for 15 minutes and decide if you want it.\nIn China they call it a mobile fitting room.\nIn South-Korea they paste a supermarket on the wall, you can scan the QR-code and it gets delivered when you get home.\nCombine drones with Lamoda up-selling? Nobody can predict what happens next."

Not yet 25 years yet, some journalists last year got it wrong.<br>\nThe all of the USSR, the first gulf war. sonic hedgehog, and my favorite: SNES.<br>\nThe web is 24 years old. Probably older than some of you in the public.<br>\nBecause we’re a young industry, we sometimes don’t know anymore why some things were like they were.<br>\nWe have to work harder to keep our past accessible. A lot of it is gone already.</p>\n<p>Learn from the past</p>\n<p>’91-’00 the Wild West<br>\nBrowser wars, Dotcom boom.</p>\n<p>’93 Mosaic browser launched. It supported inline images, before that it was all text.<br>\nCERN devoted the web to the public.<br>\n’94 W3C formed. The founders of Mosaic formed a new company called Netscape.<br>\n’95 Netscape’s IPO<br>\n’96 CSS level 1<br>\n’97 Full swing browser wars, but not in supporting CSS, more propriety features.<br>\nMicrosoft licensed Mosaic to become IE<br>\n’98 WaSP (web standards project) launched. Never meant to be an acronym, but literally a swarm of wasp. Bugging browser vendors to support new features. But people didn’t get the name, and the acronym fitted nicely.<br>\nIt was a browser upgrade campaign, inspiring users to put a banner on their site, to ask users to upgrade to a newer browser. Didn’t matter which one. It was not meant for users, but for developers to be able to start experimenting with new features.<br>\n’99 IE overtakes Netscape. Would take until 2012 before Chrome finally overtook them.</p>\n<p>Yahoo site in ’94. just a grey background, and a menu. With a list of links below it.<br>\n’95, they were experimenting with logos. That was still pretty common back then.<br>\n’96 They came out with the well known homepage most of you remember them for. This one probably stayed for 5/6 years, which was quite a long time in these days. There were little changes made in 98/99 though.</p>\n<p>Hotwired – the online version of Wired. They had the first banner ever. It had click through rates of around 80%. Nowadays we don’t even count click-throughs anymore, we just go for impressions.<br>\nAds with countdown timers, modal popups, etc. All these can be traced back to this.<br>\nBefore Google, we had Altavista. Before Gmail we had hotmail as web mail.<br>\nGeocities was the wild west for personal sites. It was the #3 most popular site once. Until they got acquired by Yahoo. It went fast after that.<br>\nTim Berners-Lee worked for CERN. It was a scientific organization, and the web was a scientist project.</p>\n<p>The web isn’t print, but everybody wanted it to be. You can’t expect something new to come around and people directly knowing what to do with it.<br>\nWe wanted the web to be a visual medium. Images, flashing images, Flash.<br>\nIn the mid 90s HTML was about presentation. Killer websites (there’s that book again, maybe I should get a copy?). Pixel GIFs. Good and bad things.<br>\nPeople would build entire sites in flash or as an image, because it has some nice features, and it would look just as they wanted to. Didn’t have to consider browsers compatibility anymore, as there just was IE now. You could make a site with visual tools, without knowing how to code.<br>\nCSS was designed to fix this, but it was not good enough to fix all this at the time.</p>\n<p>2001-2006 quiet years<br>\nThis era has defined the web. Things felt small. There was more of a community. Blog comments worked, there was no spam or flaming yet. Blogging was hot. Movable Type, WordPress. exciting time with lots of collaboration. Slack is the closest to it what we have now (So much talk of Slack, I should probably look into it).<br>\n’01 Wikipedia launched. Could you think of that we had a time before Wikipedia and Google. Well, Google is a little older, it launched in ’98, but didn’t became very know until 2000.<br>\n’02 CSS hacks started to gain ground. CSS layouts worked, except in IE. Hacks started to get a live of their own. It got out of hand quickly, just start hacking because we can. The box model hack the first CSS hack?<br>\n’03 CSS Zen Garden. This was my project, I can’t really talk about it objectively. It was build out of frustration that nobody used the standards. Jeffrey Zeldman said show people standards, don’t tell them. I was just an advertisement person talking about it.<br>\n’04 Firefox 1.0 started using the Netscape Suite and stripped it down.<br>\nWhatWG started, who you might now from the HTML5 standard.<br>\n’05 Adobe buys Macromedia. We ended up with one tool, instead of it getting improved. The state of authoring tools didn’t really grow. I like that we have tools like Sketch now to give Adobe some competition.<br>\nA List Apart. Digital web magazine was like it. many people forgot about it. It was a great way to get visibility and promote things for the web.<br>\nLaunch of Wired news. The first site with a full CSS layout. Wired was the Microsoft of that time, who was the showcase for responsive design. The fallback sites for older browsers were very ugly.<br>\nESPN came along a little bit later.

                "value": "A trip back to 1991. Not yet 25 years yet, some journalists last year got it wrong.\nThe all of the USSR, the first gulf war. sonic hedgehog, and my favorite: SNES.\nThe web is 24 years old. Probably older than some of you in the public.\nBecause we’re a young industry, we sometimes don’t know anymore why some things were like they were.\nWe have to work harder to keep our past accessible. A lot of it is gone already.\nLearn from the past\n’91-’00 the Wild West\nBrowser wars, Dotcom boom.\n’93 Mosaic browser launched. It supported inline images, before that it was all text.\nCERN devoted the web to the public.\n’94 W3C formed. The founders of Mosaic formed a new company called Netscape.\n’95 Netscape’s IPO\n’96 CSS level 1\n’97 Full swing browser wars, but not in supporting CSS, more propriety features.\nMicrosoft licensed Mosaic to become IE\n’98 WaSP (web standards project) launched. Never meant to be an acronym, but literally a swarm of wasp. Bugging browser vendors to support new features. But people didn’t get the name, and the acronym fitted nicely.\nIt was a browser upgrade campaign, inspiring users to put a banner on their site, to ask users to upgrade to a newer browser. Didn’t matter which one. It was not meant for users, but for developers to be able to start experimenting with new features.\n’99 IE overtakes Netscape. Would take until 2012 before Chrome finally overtook them.\nYahoo site in ’94. just a grey background, and a menu. With a list of links below it.\n’95, they were experimenting with logos. That was still pretty common back then.\n’96 They came out with the well known homepage most of you remember them for. This one probably stayed for 5/6 years, which was quite a long time in these days. There were little changes made in 98/99 though.\nHotwired – the online version of Wired. They had the first banner ever. It had click through rates of around 80%. Nowadays we don’t even count click-throughs anymore, we just go for impressions.\nAds with countdown timers, modal popups, etc. All these can be traced back to this.\nBefore Google, we had Altavista. Before Gmail we had hotmail as web mail.\nGeocities was the wild west for personal sites. It was the #3 most popular site once. Until they got acquired by Yahoo. It went fast after that.\nTim Berners-Lee worked for CERN. It was a scientific organization, and the web was a scientist project.\nThe web isn’t print, but everybody wanted it to be. You can’t expect something new to come around and people directly knowing what to do with it.\nWe wanted the web to be a visual medium. Images, flashing images, Flash.\nIn the mid 90s HTML was about presentation. Killer websites (there’s that book again, maybe I should get a copy?). Pixel GIFs. Good and bad things.\nPeople would build entire sites in flash or as an image, because it has some nice features, and it would look just as they wanted to. Didn’t have to consider browsers compatibility anymore, as there just was IE now. You could make a site with visual tools, without knowing how to code.\nCSS was designed to fix this, but it was not good enough to fix all this at the time.\n2001-2006 quiet years\nThis era has defined the web. Things felt small. There was more of a community. Blog comments worked, there was no spam or flaming yet. Blogging was hot. Movable Type, WordPress. exciting time with lots of collaboration. Slack is the closest to it what we have now (So much talk of Slack, I should probably look into it).\n’01 Wikipedia launched. Could you think of that we had a time before Wikipedia and Google. Well, Google is a little older, it launched in ’98, but didn’t became very know until 2000.\n’02 CSS hacks started to gain ground. CSS layouts worked, except in IE. Hacks started to get a live of their own. It got out of hand quickly, just start hacking because we can. The box model hack the first CSS hack?\n’03 CSS Zen Garden. This was my project, I can’t really talk about it objectively. It was build out of frustration that nobody used the standards. Jeffrey Zeldman said show people standards, don’t tell them. I was just an advertisement person talking about it.\n’04 Firefox 1.0 started using the Netscape Suite and stripped it down.\nWhatWG started, who you might now from the HTML5 standard.\n’05 Adobe buys Macromedia. We ended up with one tool, instead of it getting improved. The state of authoring tools didn’t really grow. I like that we have tools like Sketch now to give Adobe some competition.\nA List Apart. Digital web magazine was like it. many people forgot about it. It was a great way to get visibility and promote things for the web.\nLaunch of Wired news. The first site with a full CSS layout. Wired was the Microsoft of that time, who was the showcase for responsive design. The fallback sites for older browsers were very ugly.\nESPN came along a little bit later. The developers of both site worked at twitter later. What does that say? With Wired people said it was just a site for techie people, but that didn’t count with ESPN.\nBy this time the browser development had stalled. The update cycles went from weeks to years.

Like PPK did yesterday, I’m here to crush your soul today.</p>\n<p>I love SVG. Not because it’s the new hot thing, but because it fascinates me. I have always loved drawing and illustrations.<br>\nI was fascinated about SVG as soon as I found out about it. when I started to code looked familiar. It looked like HTML, but it is fundamentally different. So today I will give you some tips to avoid headaches I had.</p>\n<p>#1<br>\nPresentation attribute are like regular HTML attributes but intended for styling, for example: fill, stroke, etc. But they are overridden by any other declarations.</p>\n<p>Use element references on a different element like a symbol.<br>\nIf you do not apply any styles, the browser will use the defaults.</p>\n<p>svg * {all: inherit; } This is an extreme measure, as it will reset all styles on the elements. Only use it if you’ll style everything.</p>\n<p>With SVG you can use variables.

Like PPK did yesterday, I’m here to crush your soul today.\nI love SVG. Not because it’s the new hot thing, but because it fascinates me. I have always loved drawing and illustrations.\nI was fascinated about SVG as soon as I found out about it. when I started to code looked familiar. It looked like HTML, but it is fundamentally different. So today I will give you some tips to avoid headaches I had.\n#1\nPresentation attribute are like regular HTML attributes but intended for styling, for example: fill, stroke, etc. But they are overridden by any other declarations.\nUse element references on a different element like a symbol.\nIf you do not apply any styles, the browser will use the defaults.\nsvg * {all: inherit; } This is an extreme measure, as it will reset all styles on the elements. Only use it if you’ll style everything.\nWith SVG you can use variables. Define them in CSS with –coll and reference them (with –coll) in SVG.\n#2\nThere are 6 different ways to embed SVG: <svg>, <embed>, <iframe>, <object>, css background, and <img>.\nRecently the <picture> element was added to this list.\nPages with targets open in the same part. use xlink:target to fix it. But you need to set the namespace first.\n#3 Setting the fill property to “none” disables pointer attributes.\nUse fill:transparent; or change the value of pointer events.\n#4\n<script xlink:href> Values in  the script like <,>,& will sometimes be interpreted as HTML. Use CDATA to fix it.\n#5 SVG viewbox attribute\nSVG has a limit in width and height, just like an iframe. But can have a different width/height inside of the view. This scales the SVG.\nClip it with clip-width that equals width of element.\n#6\nCSSOM (CSS Object Model) methods on SVG give unexpected results. Use SVG functions instead.\n#7 SVG lacks relative positioning.\nNo z-index, everything is absolute positioned. If you want to overlay things, the order of objects needs to be changed in the source.\nSVG doesn’t have a box model\nYou can fake overlaying by nesting <svg> tags.\n#8 Sizes in editors and generated tools won’t always be right in SVG. Needs a bit of modification. error-prone."

The things we do today (at Typekit?) looks nothing like what we did a few years ago. I work as a venture capitalist now in a Silicon Valley business. Not very common for a designer, but I think a user-centric and design-led culture is good for a business.</p>\n<p>I could give a talk about capitalism, but this is Europe. This talk will be about culture.</p>\n<p>Imagine paddling down a river towards the sunset. Just you and the elements of nature. Suddenly your boat tips over and you end up in the water, grasping for air. When you look around you see some kids swimming away, laughing at you. What do you feel? Anger? Fear? Anxiety? Maybe all of them.<br>\nNow go back a few moments before and instead of getting tipped over, you look around and saw that your boat ran into a floating log. Would you feel the same? Probably not. They’re pretty much the same situation, than why are you feelings not the same? The feeling you should have is equanimity – grace under pressure.<br>\nAnother example, one morning I woke up at 6.24am to the sound of water. It came from the bathroom, and there I found my son pushing down rolls of toilet paper down the toilet with a plunger. He was very proudly working down his third roll already (I always found it amazing how people always manage to take a picture of this first in these kind of situations). As a parent you know the feelings rushing through you at that moment.</p>\n<p>Typekit allows you to use custom web fonts on your website. When you choose a font on our site, your fonts get compiled for you into something we call la kit. Next the kit gets moved to our CDN where it’s placed at the origin server, and gets distributed from there.<br>\nJeffrey shows a graph about how their server load normally looks, and how it was showing a sudden spike one day. After some investigation it seemed like s lot of kits were stuck in the queue on the road to the CDN.<br>\nOn normal days they hold a short morning meeting about all the active projects going on, but that morning it was all about that spike. One of our customers seemed to be creating a very large amount of traffic via the API. So I call their CEO, and say that they’re doing a great job. The CEO agrees and tells him that they just released their new site to 400k users. Great! Nice that you informed us about it up front.<br>\nHe goes on telling that there will be more coverage coming the next Monday, as they just got acquired. This all happened just before the Thanksgiving weekend. We got a group of engineers together and made a plan. We had three days to be able to handle 3 times more traffic than that’s crippling us at the moment.<br>\nWe decided we had to identify the problem on Friday, build the solution on Saturday and integrate it with the rest of the site on Sunday.<br>\nWe tried to do it like NASA, where they created a room where everybody knew what to do.<br>\nSo then we removed all the business decisions, and provide them with all the moral support (in the fridge ;-)). There would be one person who would update us regularly, and discussing what they needed. So everybody else could work on fixing the problem<br>\nHere equanimity comes in. We set everything up, structured everything. Let all the anger go about the situation you’re in.<br>\nFirst we looked at generating the kits, that only took milliseconds to do. Clearly that wasn’t the problem. There was no problem with the bandwidth either. But everything was clogging on the way to the CDN server.<br>\nWith the problem being outside of our infrastructure, and not having the time to wait on our provider to fix it. We chose to ignore the CDN and started to build our own.<br>\nThis had been on our list of things to-do for a long time, it was going to be a project that would take three months. Only instead of doing it in 3 months, we had to do it on Saturday now. On Sunday morning they had a just viable service.<br>\nThere was a tremendous amount of traffic on Monday, but our new CDN managed to handle it quite well.</p>\n<p>What did we learn?<br>\nThere are enough lessons to learn here, but I’ll focus on just one.<br>\nThe world is complex, we are connected to everything and everything breaks. Everything we do is user experience. It felt like it was always holding him back in doing what he wanted by making the best user experience. Perhaps the biggest thing we learned is that teams thrive if they have equanimity.<br>\nIf you look at sports, and more specifically at cycling. The journalists often ask about somebody’s changes, and if they say they will win and do they’re all amazed. And if they ask how he did it he said “The team was very strong”. Cycling like how birds do it, they keep somebody out of the wind.</p>\n<p>“Some people believe tension is a good creative tool. I’m not one of those people” – Steven Soderbergh. Not controlling his actors, but trying to amplify them.</p>\n<p>The old way of motivation is based on factory work, where human labor is asset you need to squeeze as much as you can. In a creative environment other things are needed. Like shared values, trust, and camaraderie. What working at a start-up is really about is a shared feel of values.</p>\n<p>This is about meetings. “If you are tired and alone, you can always hold a meeting.”<br>\nWe had a set of meetings that helped us reach equanimity.<br>\nThe first type of meeting is the chat room. Email is corrupt, we need to over-communicate to act distributed. Chat does that better. Email is a large communication medium, not about compression.<br>\nThe information you needed was only available in the chat-room. Created a set of accountability. And yes, things like animated GIFs are part of it.</p>\n<p>I was always very frustrated with meetings. In a distributed setup it was easy to feel adrift. We aimed to get it as fast as we can. We started it at 10.05 because nobody would be late. If we started at 10.00 it would often take half an hour to get everybody there, but if we did it at 10.05 everybody would be there. I have no idea why it works that day.<br>\nEvery single person in the company would be there. What at the time was about 30 people. One of the rules is nobody gets to talk. Only the people running the meeting and the person running a project. No problem solving in meetings, or else the rest would be waiting. But everybody could do it in parallel afterwards.</p>\n<p>We just had a text file as a project management tool.

                "value": "Video is available here: https://vimeo.com/129198643\nI left Adobe last year. The things we do today (at Typekit?) looks nothing like what we did a few years ago. I work as a venture capitalist now in a Silicon Valley business. Not very common for a designer, but I think a user-centric and design-led culture is good for a business.\nI could give a talk about capitalism, but this is Europe. This talk will be about culture.\nImagine paddling down a river towards the sunset. Just you and the elements of nature. Suddenly your boat tips over and you end up in the water, grasping for air. When you look around you see some kids swimming away, laughing at you. What do you feel? Anger? Fear? Anxiety? Maybe all of them.\nNow go back a few moments before and instead of getting tipped over, you look around and saw that your boat ran into a floating log. Would you feel the same? Probably not. They’re pretty much the same situation, than why are you feelings not the same? The feeling you should have is equanimity – grace under pressure.\nAnother example, one morning I woke up at 6.24am to the sound of water. It came from the bathroom, and there I found my son pushing down rolls of toilet paper down the toilet with a plunger. He was very proudly working down his third roll already (I always found it amazing how people always manage to take a picture of this first in these kind of situations). As a parent you know the feelings rushing through you at that moment.\nTypekit allows you to use custom web fonts on your website. When you choose a font on our site, your fonts get compiled for you into something we call la kit. Next the kit gets moved to our CDN where it’s placed at the origin server, and gets distributed from there.\nJeffrey shows a graph about how their server load normally looks, and how it was showing a sudden spike one day. After some investigation it seemed like s lot of kits were stuck in the queue on the road to the CDN.\nOn normal days they hold a short morning meeting about all the active projects going on, but that morning it was all about that spike. One of our customers seemed to be creating a very large amount of traffic via the API. So I call their CEO, and say that they’re doing a great job. The CEO agrees and tells him that they just released their new site to 400k users. Great! Nice that you informed us about it up front.\nHe goes on telling that there will be more coverage coming the next Monday, as they just got acquired. This all happened just before the Thanksgiving weekend. We got a group of engineers together and made a plan. We had three days to be able to handle 3 times more traffic than that’s crippling us at the moment.\nWe decided we had to identify the problem on Friday, build the solution on Saturday and integrate it with the rest of the site on Sunday.\nWe tried to do it like NASA, where they created a room where everybody knew what to do.\nSo then we removed all the business decisions, and provide them with all the moral support (in the fridge ;-)). There would be one person who would update us regularly, and discussing what they needed. So everybody else could work on fixing the problem\nHere equanimity comes in. We set everything up, structured everything. Let all the anger go about the situation you’re in.\nFirst we looked at generating the kits, that only took milliseconds to do. Clearly that wasn’t the problem. There was no problem with the bandwidth either. But everything was clogging on the way to the CDN server.\nWith the problem being outside of our infrastructure, and not having the time to wait on our provider to fix it. We chose to ignore the CDN and started to build our own.\nThis had been on our list of things to-do for a long time, it was going to be a project that would take three months. Only instead of doing it in 3 months, we had to do it on Saturday now. On Sunday morning they had a just viable service.\nThere was a tremendous amount of traffic on Monday, but our new CDN managed to handle it quite well.\nWhat did we learn?\nThere are enough lessons to learn here, but I’ll focus on just one.\nThe world is complex, we are connected to everything and everything breaks. Everything we do is user experience. It felt like it was always holding him back in doing what he wanted by making the best user experience. Perhaps the biggest thing we learned is that teams thrive if they have equanimity.\nIf you look at sports, and more specifically at cycling. The journalists often ask about somebody’s changes, and if they say they will win and do they’re all amazed. And if they ask how he did it he said “The team was very strong”. Cycling like how birds do it, they keep somebody out of the wind.\n“Some people believe tension is a good creative tool. I’m not one of those people” – Steven Soderbergh. Not controlling his actors, but trying to amplify them.\nThe old way of motivation is based on factory work, where human labor is asset you need to squeeze as much as you can. In a creative environment other things are needed. Like shared values, trust, and camaraderie. What working at a start-up is really about is a shared feel of values.\nThis is about meetings. “If you are tired and alone, you can always hold a meeting.”\nWe had a set of meetings that helped us reach equanimity.\nThe first type of meeting is the chat room. Email is corrupt, we need to over-communicate to act distributed. Chat does that better. Email is a large communication medium, not about compression.\nThe information you needed was only available in the chat-room. Created a set of accountability. And yes, things like animated GIFs are part of it.\nI was always very frustrated with meetings. In a distributed setup it was easy to feel adrift. We aimed to get it as fast as we can. We started it at 10.05 because nobody would be late. If we started at 10.00 it would often take half an hour to get everybody there, but if we did it at 10.05 everybody would be there. I have no idea why it works that day.\nEvery single person in the company would be there. What at the time was about 30 people. One of the rules is nobody gets to talk. Only the people running the meeting and the person running a project. No problem solving in meetings, or else the rest would be waiting. But everybody could do it in parallel afterwards.\nWe just had a text file as a project management tool. There was a daily email to everybody on the team to keep them updated.\nMeeting two: the weekly meeting\nThis one happened on Friday afternoon with beers and we shared what had happened during the week. Issues closed, things shipped. Valuing design in everything.\nMeeting three: product review.\nThe first product review I had was when I still worked at Google and it was terrible. If you presented it was a bunch of engineers shooting things down. Nobody knew how to give good feedback.\nWith us this was an optional meeting. But if you are there, participation is mandatory. We don’t leave the room until the problems we’re discussing are solved. It is not a forum for expressing opinions.\nBad: I don’t like that blue.\nBetter: Why is that blue.\nGreat: Is color important here.\nWill it be a convergent or a divergent meeting.\nDivergence: solving a problem. like brainstorming.\nConvergence: evaluate, drive towards consensus.\nThis is why these meetings go wrong, people have the wrong expectations.\nOne thing that was important is user testing with the right expectations. Use it to build empathy, see them use your project. Purely qualitative. More exposure to users means better design instincts for everybody involved.\nSometimes we would explore Behance together. more exposure to great work gives you a better design vocabulary.\nGood taste can be cultivated. You can work on it as a team.\nLast meeting: post-mortem.\nNobody wants to be there. This one comes from manufacturing. test-driven development with multiple setups a day, can also cause a lot of problems.\nThe person who pushed the button, thought it was the right thing to do. It’s the human nature to look for the villain. It’s called the fundamental attribution error, very well know in psychology. That person is an idiot and don’t know what they’re doing. People should feel safe experimenting, and we shouldn’t be blaming people.\nSakichi Toyoda. He always asked why 5 times to get to the root of a problem.\nJeff Bezos used to do the same thing at Amazon. One of the warehouses was shut down because somebody got his finger in between one of the machines. The cause wasn’t that he was an idiot, but that there wasn’t a place to store his stuff what caused his bag to fall on the machine and him trying to get it out and getting injured in the process.\nZoom out. Purpose is timeless. People with a clear purpose have a longer life expectancy.\nThe ability to communicate across generation is why some civilizations succeeded, where others failed."

A city that’s beautiful and shambling at the same time. One thing I don’t like is that it’s filthy.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When you look at the litter in the city, there’s always other people to look at. People blame city workers not doing a good job, animal owners who don’t clean up, kids who get home from school and throw their stuff on the floor.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The city doesn’t want this filth either so they make campaigns about it. And laws. There’s a whole chapter in the city code. It’s not that hard actually.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>But I also love the web. I work with content all the time. I knew I would write since I was 6. I like a lot of it. I think a lot of sites are ugly too.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>I got to the Verizon site. I was trying to decide if I should stay or go to a different provider. So I got to their site and after scrolling, I got to the section trending now. There’s an article about metadata. I look at the photo. It clearly looks like a stck photo, but who makes such a thing? It’s even worse if it was custom made than not. What would Verizon do about metadata?<br>\nAs I am a content strategist I click and go down the rabbit hole. Soon I realize it’s a garbage article about metadata. Some standard text that doesn’t even help. How could it be, as it’s not about them. About their business.</p>\n<p>But I notice I ended up somewhere else, on the solutions lab. I click on and get at a weird collection of articles. It asks me if would like to download a paper. I’m going all the way down now, so I say yes of course. I get an FAQ and all the way at the end it says: “How do I sign up?”. That’s not an FAQ. That’s a Call-to-action, and a very bad one.<br>\nHow many people get all the way down here and don’t know what’s happening.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Why is content so difficult to do well?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Content is always late, too long. not mobile ready. A PDF of 99 pages. Some PowerPoint. The content is messy.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>My job is to help people fix stuff like this. I think a lot of people have been talking about it. Spending time on making content better.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>We can’t change anything because this department wants it. And BTW, the CEO still wants her letter on the homepage. You try to keep the content up with the chaos. but it always catches up with you. It feels like a game of whack-a-mole.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Time for a new approach. The idea to fix content is exhausting.</p>\n<p>I try to think about content, companies and the sites we work with as difficult. I try to think of it as cities. They are chaotic and imperfect. You have to change a lot of little things over a long time. The same is true for organizations and content. What we can do is turn projects into a catalyst. Do something for the longer term. As opposed to looking at the next redesign.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Something that helped me and you can all use. Change feels difficult. People have given up because it’s demoralizing. People want to do a given job, but if things feel big people stop trying.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Citizen-driven effort to revitalize one Philadelphia city block on West Rockland Street. Only trying to fix their block. We can’t change everything, but we can fix this block.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Big problems feel big. We go in with a grand idea: the only thing you have to do is rewrite everything. Cut everything in half to work for mobile. Transform all 4.567 PDFs to structured content. It’s hard for them. Avoid the overwhelm.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>I’m starting with just one thing. I want something that’s visible, valuable and scope-able.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Visible: something that causes pain. For visitors complaining, or employees who have to work with it.</li>\n<li>Valuable:  What is something that has immediate value for the company and it’s users, that you can get people behind with.</li>\n<li>Scope-able: What can be changed in a reasonable period of time.

                "value": "My favourite Chaos, Magic Gardens in Philadelphia by Alex Thomson (CC-BY-SA 2.0).\n \nOf course Sara describes it much better herself in the blog post on which this talk is based, but writing is remembering, right?\n \nIt’s actually ugly, but also what I like about Philly. A city that’s beautiful and shambling at the same time. One thing I don’t like is that it’s filthy.\n \nWhen you look at the litter in the city, there’s always other people to look at. People blame city workers not doing a good job, animal owners who don’t clean up, kids who get home from school and throw their stuff on the floor.\n \nThe city doesn’t want this filth either so they make campaigns about it. And laws. There’s a whole chapter in the city code. It’s not that hard actually.\n \nBut I also love the web. I work with content all the time. I knew I would write since I was 6. I like a lot of it. I think a lot of sites are ugly too.\n \nI got to the Verizon site. I was trying to decide if I should stay or go to a different provider. So I got to their site and after scrolling, I got to the section trending now. There’s an article about metadata. I look at the photo. It clearly looks like a stck photo, but who makes such a thing? It’s even worse if it was custom made than not. What would Verizon do about metadata?\nAs I am a content strategist I click and go down the rabbit hole. Soon I realize it’s a garbage article about metadata. Some standard text that doesn’t even help. How could it be, as it’s not about them. About their business.\nBut I notice I ended up somewhere else, on the solutions lab. I click on and get at a weird collection of articles. It asks me if would like to download a paper. I’m going all the way down now, so I say yes of course. I get an FAQ and all the way at the end it says: “How do I sign up?”. That’s not an FAQ. That’s a Call-to-action, and a very bad one.\nHow many people get all the way down here and don’t know what’s happening.\n \nWhy is content so difficult to do well?\n \nContent is always late, too long. not mobile ready. A PDF of 99 pages. Some PowerPoint. The content is messy.\n \nMy job is to help people fix stuff like this. I think a lot of people have been talking about it. Spending time on making content better.\n \nWe can’t change anything because this department wants it. And BTW, the CEO still wants her letter on the homepage. You try to keep the content up with the chaos. but it always catches up with you. It feels like a game of whack-a-mole.\n \nTime for a new approach. The idea to fix content is exhausting.\nI try to think about content, companies and the sites we work with as difficult. I try to think of it as cities. They are chaotic and imperfect. You have to change a lot of little things over a long time. The same is true for organizations and content. What we can do is turn projects into a catalyst. Do something for the longer term. As opposed to looking at the next redesign.\n \nSomething that helped me and you can all use. Change feels difficult. People have given up because it’s demoralizing. People want to do a given job, but if things feel big people stop trying.\n \nCitizen-driven effort to revitalize one Philadelphia city block on West Rockland Street. Only trying to fix their block. We can’t change everything, but we can fix this block.\n \nBig problems feel big. We go in with a grand idea: the only thing you have to do is rewrite everything. Cut everything in half to work for mobile. Transform all 4.567 PDFs to structured content. It’s hard for them. Avoid the overwhelm.\n \nI’m starting with just one thing. I want something that’s visible, valuable and scope-able.\n\nVisible: something that causes pain. For visitors complaining, or employees who have to work with it.\nValuable:  What is something that has immediate value for the company and it’s users, that you can get people behind with.\nScope-able: What can be changed in a reasonable period of time. People need to see some results if you want to keep them engaged.\n\nFind where your skills align with the customers problem.\n \nFor example, let’s say you’re part of the team changing an existing site to responsive design. Everybody is excitedly resizing their browser windows. Along the way, you come upon those thousands of old PDFs. They’re not ideal, but there are far too many to deal with now. What if you found a subset for example, something like product spec sheets?\nYou’ve just found your one thing.

Changes the UA (User agent) identifier. Pretends to be desktop Chrome. He thinks Windows, but not sure. It will not be called a mobile browser in the stats. This can not be helped.</p>\n<p>If you don’t log into Google Play, you won’t get Chrome updates. Particularly in China (because of The Great Firewall ?).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Device vendors use older Chromia (plural form of Chromium according to PPK) as their default browsers.</p>\n<p>Samsung used Chromium 18 starting at Galaxy S4. Now they updated to Chromium 28. WebView is Chromium 30.</p>\n<p>30% of users prefer Google’s Chrome (version 40 in the stats) above Samsung’s version.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Why did Samsung do this?</p>\n<p>Androids purpose was people using Google services, so Google could keep getting data and serve targeted ads. Made sense to offer Android for free. Still does.</p>\n<p>In 2009 device vendors needed an answer to the iPhone. Android was readily available. Takes a lot of work to make an operating system, look at Firefox OS.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Nokia and BlackBerry thought they could survive, but they were too slow. Nokia had a good plan only never executed it, and got bought by Microsoft. There will be new Android phones in 2016 from the Nokia part that’s still independent.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Device vendors wanted to differentiate themselves. Not wanting to look the same with the same OS. That’s why vendors starts to differentiate. Google allowed Android differentiation.</p>\n<p>Venders will change things because they can. Create their own interface layers.</p>\n<p>Google had to allow this to get Android adopted. But they didn’t like this fragmentation. That’s why it gets called differentiation by people who like it and fragmentation by people who don’t. Read Android news through this lens, and it’ll tell you who supports it and who opposes it.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Let’s talk a bit about browsers (Weren’t we doing that already?)</p>\n<p>Device vendors refuse to give their browsers names. The default browser is called Android WebKit or stock browser.<br>\nEach device vendor modified it slightly. There are 120 switches they can change. Which led to a lot WebKits. If you have two WebKits it doesn’t mean they render the same.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>These things have changed as Google wanted to push Chrome. And because Chrome is a better browser, it’s good for us. Google stopped the development of Android WebKit (A <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/10/googles-iron-grip-on-android-controlling-open-source-by-any-means-necessary/\">very good piece</a> about why Google stopped with various stock Android features). Device vendors can stick with it, or change to Chrome. Webkit had quite a lot of bugs, some of which are very serious 0-days.</p>\n<p>…or the could build their own Chromium. Which is exactly what they did. So we ended up with exact to the same situation only now with Chromes.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Sony is an interesting one.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>64% Chromium 40</li>\n<li>23% Chromium 33</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Most people use the regular Chrome. Chromium 33 is the WebView. Sony is the only vendor that uses the default Chrome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Nexus, Motorola, and Sony use latest Chrome. Motorola got sold to Lenovo, so probably a Lenovo-Motorola Chrome will appear soon.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Samsung: Chromium 28</li>\n<li>HTC: Chromium 33 used WebKit before, but got over the air updated to chrome.</li>\n<li>LG: Chromium 30 or 34</li>\n<li>Xiaomi: Chromium 34 or 35.</li>\n<li>Cyanogen: Chromium 33</li>\n<li>Huawei: Chromium 30</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Some time ago I met with a friend who showed his new, shiny high-end LG. And I asked what’s the browser. What’s the browser. What’s the browser. If I see your phone I’ll always ask what’s the browser is three times, or until I actually know what the browser is. It was Chrome 30. I went to the store the next day and bought a mid-end LG, to add to my test-suite. Which used an older chromium. 30. 34 has certain features that require high-end hardware.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Asian companies won’t answer you. I tried it a few times, but you won’t get any answers.<br>\nWho has heard of Xiaomi? It is a Chinese company, aims to be the Asian version of Apple. Their hardware is pretty nice. If you want a Chinese phone, go for Xiaomi. Got one from China and it ran on WebKit. After update it still was on WebKit. But this WebKit was very different from other WebKits. After more tests it seemed to be a Chrome, but it didn’t show in the UA string. It probably is 34 or 35. Has something that got introduced in 33, but not something that got removed from 36.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>WebViews</p>\n<p>It’s an embedded browser. If you use something in an app, it doesn’t start the browser, but the WebView.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>&lt; 4.3 Android WebKit</li>\n<li>4.4: Chromium 30</li>\n<li>4.4.3: Chromium 33</li>\n<li>5: Chromium 42, via updates</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can’t create your own WebView anymore as a vendor, but you can change the default browser.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This clearly isn’t complicated enough</p>\n<p>Updates via the vendor go very slow. Google introduced Services a package of crucial apps, like Maps, YouTube, Play… and Chrome.</p>\n<p>Device vendors may opt-in or opt-out of the entire package. No picking and choosing!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>But this doesn’t make it the default browser.</p>\n<p>For example Samsung’s, default browser is Chrome 28, but Chrome 42 can be found in the apps.</p>\n<p>Google hopes user find the app and start using it. On Samsung this worked for about 40% of the users (huh? misspoken?).</p>\n<p>Amazon doesn’t want to use Google Services, as they have competing services. Chinese vendors opt-out too, because China doesn’t like Google (the government?).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Other browser: Chrome, Firefox and UC</p>\n<p>Are not being used as a default outside of China.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Firefox is dead on mobile.</li>\n<li>Opera is doing OK with mini, but the full browser has never done much.</li>\n<li>UC is doing fine in China, with their proxy browser.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p>What’s the difference</p>\n<p>Most browsers show only a part if you zoom in. HTC does zoom re-flow, re-flows the text so it fits in your screen. Why does it do this? Broadly: differentiation. This is a performance hit, as it has to be recalculated.<br>\nOnce saw it on Samsung, but only happens with a certain gesture combination.<br>\nDoes this work. Will consumers notice the difference?

                "value": "@ppk‘s slides are online here (PDF)\nChrome on iOS isn’t Chrome. Apple doesn’t allow other rendering engines. If you want to make a browser on iOS you need to use WebKit. Uses Apple WebView.\nThe only advantage to Chrome on iOS is that it lets you connect to Google Cloud en Services.\n \nIn South Korea you have a browsers called Puffin. Not going to talk about it, but the mobile web has a lot of strange browsers.\nMobile browser shares 2014. Global.\n\n24% Android browser\n23% Safari\n19% Chrome\n12% Opera\n10% UC – Chinese browser.\n\n \nGermany\n\n35% Chrome\n32% Android\n26% Safari\n\n \nIndia\n\n35% UC\n25% Opera\n22% Others\n12% Android\n\n \nWho knows about Proxy browsers? Good, a lot. I’m not going to talk about it, so ask anybody who raised their hands. (It’s a browser that collects all the required data for the requested URL and parses it there, to send it back as a nice small package, BTW).\n \nWe’re going to talk about Chrome.\nNetherlands\n\n39% Chromium 40\n27% Chromium 28\n18% Chromium 30\n\n \nThe Netherlands has 65% Samsung phones. Samsung only\n\n40% Chromium 28\n30% Chromium 40\n21% Chromium 30\n\n \nChromium on Android has a desktop view. Changes the UA (User agent) identifier. Pretends to be desktop Chrome. He thinks Windows, but not sure. It will not be called a mobile browser in the stats. This can not be helped.\nIf you don’t log into Google Play, you won’t get Chrome updates. Particularly in China (because of The Great Firewall ?).\n \nDevice vendors use older Chromia (plural form of Chromium according to PPK) as their default browsers.\nSamsung used Chromium 18 starting at Galaxy S4. Now they updated to Chromium 28. WebView is Chromium 30.\n30% of users prefer Google’s Chrome (version 40 in the stats) above Samsung’s version.\n \nWhy did Samsung do this?\nAndroids purpose was people using Google services, so Google could keep getting data and serve targeted ads. Made sense to offer Android for free. Still does.\nIn 2009 device vendors needed an answer to the iPhone. Android was readily available. Takes a lot of work to make an operating system, look at Firefox OS.\n \nNokia and BlackBerry thought they could survive, but they were too slow. Nokia had a good plan only never executed it, and got bought by Microsoft. There will be new Android phones in 2016 from the Nokia part that’s still independent.\n \nDevice vendors wanted to differentiate themselves. Not wanting to look the same with the same OS. That’s why vendors starts to differentiate. Google allowed Android differentiation.\nVenders will change things because they can. Create their own interface layers.\nGoogle had to allow this to get Android adopted. But they didn’t like this fragmentation. That’s why it gets called differentiation by people who like it and fragmentation by people who don’t. Read Android news through this lens, and it’ll tell you who supports it and who opposes it.\n \nLet’s talk a bit about browsers (Weren’t we doing that already?)\nDevice vendors refuse to give their browsers names. The default browser is called Android WebKit or stock browser.\nEach device vendor modified it slightly. There are 120 switches they can change. Which led to a lot WebKits. If you have two WebKits it doesn’t mean they render the same.\n \nThese things have changed as Google wanted to push Chrome. And because Chrome is a better browser, it’s good for us. Google stopped the development of Android WebKit (A very good piece about why Google stopped with various stock Android features). Device vendors can stick with it, or change to Chrome. Webkit had quite a lot of bugs, some of which are very serious 0-days.\n…or the could build their own Chromium. Which is exactly what they did. So we ended up with exact to the same situation only now with Chromes.\n \nSony is an interesting one.\n\n64% Chromium 40\n23% Chromium 33\n\nMost people use the regular Chrome. Chromium 33 is the WebView. Sony is the only vendor that uses the default Chrome.\n \nNexus, Motorola, and Sony use latest Chrome. Motorola got sold to Lenovo, so probably a Lenovo-Motorola Chrome will appear soon.\n\nSamsung: Chromium 28\nHTC: Chromium 33 used WebKit before, but got over the air updated to chrome.\nLG: Chromium 30 or 34\nXiaomi: Chromium 34 or 35.\nCyanogen: Chromium 33\nHuawei: Chromium 30\n\n \nSome time ago I met with a friend who showed his new, shiny high-end LG. And I asked what’s the browser. What’s the browser. What’s the browser. If I see your phone I’ll always ask what’s the browser is three times, or until I actually know what the browser is. It was Chrome 30. I went to the store the next day and bought a mid-end LG, to add to my test-suite. Which used an older chromium. 30. 34 has certain features that require high-end hardware.\n \nAsian companies won’t answer you. I tried it a few times, but you won’t get any answers.\nWho has heard of Xiaomi? It is a Chinese company, aims to be the Asian version of Apple. Their hardware is pretty nice. If you want a Chinese phone, go for Xiaomi. Got one from China and it ran on WebKit. After update it still was on WebKit. But this WebKit was very different from other WebKits. After more tests it seemed to be a Chrome, but it didn’t show in the UA string. It probably is 34 or 35. Has something that got introduced in 33, but not something that got removed from 36.\n \nWebViews\nIt’s an embedded browser. If you use something in an app, it doesn’t start the browser, but the WebView.\n\n< 4.3 Android WebKit\n4.4: Chromium 30\n4.4.3: Chromium 33\n5: Chromium 42, via updates\n\nYou can’t create your own WebView anymore as a vendor, but you can change the default browser.\n \nThis clearly isn’t complicated enough\nUpdates via the vendor go very slow. Google introduced Services a package of crucial apps, like Maps, YouTube, Play… and Chrome.\nDevice vendors may opt-in or opt-out of the entire package. No picking and choosing!\n \nBut this doesn’t make it the default browser.\nFor example Samsung’s, default browser is Chrome 28, but Chrome 42 can be found in the apps.\nGoogle hopes user find the app and start using it. On Samsung this worked for about 40% of the users (huh? misspoken?).\nAmazon doesn’t want to use Google Services, as they have competing services. Chinese vendors opt-out too, because China doesn’t like Google (the government?).\n \nOther browser: Chrome, Firefox and UC\nAre not being used as a default outside of China.\n\nFirefox is dead on mobile.\nOpera is doing OK with mini, but the full browser has never done much.\nUC is doing fine in China, with their proxy browser.\n\n \nWhat’s the difference\nMost browsers show only a part if you zoom in. HTC does zoom re-flow, re-flows the text so it fits in your screen. Why does it do this? Broadly: differentiation. This is a performance hit, as it has to be recalculated.\nOnce saw it on Samsung, but only happens with a certain gesture combination.\nDoes this work. Will consumers notice the difference? I knew one guy who had a HTC before, and switched to Samsung but will switch back again because of the zooming.\n \nInput type “datetime”. How many use it? A few. You get a very ugly interface on desktop, why probably not many of you use it. Looks magnificent on smartphones.\nHTC, LG and Samsung support it.\nGoogle, Opera, Xiaomi, Cyanogen don’t, but they do support date and time separately.\n \nBorder-radius 3px doesn’t work on Samsung 19, but separate radius worked. They disabled because of performance issues. But they forgot to remove the long-hand version.\nDefault of CSS property left: 0 or auto?\nSamsung uses 0, the rest uses auto.\n \nPosition: fixed on Chromium is a problem – Chrome 18-39\nChanges when the user zooms, to keep it on screen obscuring the view. Doesn’t happen anymore since 40.\n \nHow to deal with it.\nTest each phone carefully. Not exactly the browser. Can be hard with certain by looking at the browsers. WebKit UA strings don’t have Chrome in it. Chrome usually does, not always..\nBut that doesn’t mean it’s Google Chrome. If it’s an older version it is a vendor’s Chrome.\nIf you’re uncertain. Use the pointer media query.\nIf you want to create a test lab, you should have at least these devices:\n\nHigh-end Samsung\nMid-range Samsung\nHTC\nLG\n\nDon’t bother with Nexus, very few people use it. Only devs like us."
