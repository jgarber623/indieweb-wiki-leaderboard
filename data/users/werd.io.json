While it was originally created as an alternative to surveillance capitalism, its anti-banning stance caused it to provide a home to white supremacists banned from mainstream networks in the wake of the January 6 insurrection. (Indeed, Trump had invited its founders to the White House alongside the founders of the networks listed above in 2019.)</p>\n<p>Over there, a popular post states:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://werd.io/file/63478bd5dd501d126638cb42/thumb.png\" alt=\"Jews in our government need to be pulled out by the root like weeds-there are reasons Hitlers first move as chancellor was to remove all Jews from parliament-he knew what they were and still are today-Communists!\" width=\"1024\" height=\"149\"></p>\n<p>Minds has over two million users.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>GETTR</strong> is another conservative Twitter clone, this time founded by a former Trump aide. Here the anti-semitism is less overt, although a few comments from fringe accounts did talk about “the satanic Jews”, which was a trope on the other networks.</p>\n<p>GETTR also has around 4 million users.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Parler</strong>, which also emerged during the Trump era, is hopelessly unusable. I couldn’t figure out how to search for content on it, when it even managed to log me in.</p>\n<p>Parler claims to have a million users, but I don't know how.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>It’s not a partisan statement to say that I find these comments to be utterly chilling both in terms of their content and their effective endorsement by large-scale backers that include the former President of the United States.</p>\n<p>I’m also deeply unhappy with how my open source code was used to build Minds. I don’t believe its founders to be anti-semites, but I do think that tolerance of this kind of hatred is not anything approaching the virtue that they think it is. While these sorts of hateful ideas can certainly be countered by better ones, it’s also certainly true that alternative social networking sites have been used to plan undemocratic insurrections and hate crimes that led to real harm.</p>\n<p>Mainstream social networks, particularly Facebook, are not off the hook here: banning anti-semitism does not absolve you of complicity in genocide elsewhere. Twitter also has its fair share of discoverable posts that espouse anti-semitic tropes. But these other networks are remarkable for their concentration: whereas these ideas are a tiny fringe on Facebook and Twitter, they’re how these other networks support themselves. You go to an alt network because you’ve been banned - or you’re worried you will be banned - from a traditional one. This concentration of extremists is why <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2021/01/17/957512634/social-media-site-gab-is-surging-even-as-critics-blame-it-for-capitol-violence\">much of the insurrection was able to be openly organized on networks like Gab</a>.</p>\n<p>The Southern Poverty Law Center noted as such in its <a href=\"https://www.splcenter.org/20220309/year-hate-extremism-report-2021\">The Year in Hate &amp; Extremism Report 2021</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Hate groups and other extremists do not solely rely on mainstream social media platforms to spread their message — they are increasingly using “alt-tech” platforms that are often advertised as “free speech” alternatives to places like Twitter and Facebook. On these platforms, users don’t have to worry about content moderation. These include video platforms like Bitchute and Odysee and social media sites like Gab.</p></blockquote>\n<p>And there does seem to be a growing, violent movement lurking here. <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/antisemitic-incidents-hit-a-record-high-in-2021-whats-behind-the-rise-in-hate\">Incidents of antisemitism in America hit an all-time high in 2021</a>. I’m certain that this is in no small part because overtly racist town squares have become easier than ever to be a part of. These networks have millions of users, are growing, encourage real hate crime, and have ringing endorsements from people who have held the highest office in the land. We overlook them as sideshows at our peril.</p>",

If you haven't noticed you're not supposed to point out that Hollywood, banks, and many other things are dominated by a cabal of satanic jews. Truth Social has around 2 million users. Gab was founded in 2016 as the first right-wing alternative social network. The founder (who has 3.7 million followers) writes: Kanye criticizes Jewish people and instantly gets banned from all social media platforms and banks. Funny how that keeps happening to people who do so. In response to a post that asks \"who runs JP Morgan Chase?\" hundreds of users respond with some variation of \"the Jews\".Gab has around 4 million users. Minds was founded in 2011 and originally built on top of Elgg, the open source social networking framework I co-founded. While it was originally created as an alternative to surveillance capitalism, its anti-banning stance caused it to provide a home to white supremacists banned from mainstream networks in the wake of the January 6 insurrection. (Indeed, Trump had invited its founders to the White House alongside the founders of the networks listed above in 2019.)Over there, a popular post states: Jews in our government need to be pulled out by the root like weeds-there are reasons Hitlers first move as chancellor was to remove all Jews from parliament-he knew what they were and still are today-Communists! Minds has over two million users. GETTR is another conservative Twitter clone, this time founded by a former Trump aide. Here the anti-semitism is less overt, although a few comments from fringe accounts did talk about “the satanic Jews”, which was a trope on the other networks.GETTR also has around 4 million users. Parler, which also emerged during the Trump era, is hopelessly unusable. I couldn’t figure out how to search for content on it, when it even managed to log me in.Parler claims to have a million users, but I don't know how. It’s not a partisan statement to say that I find these comments to be utterly chilling both in terms of their content and their effective endorsement by large-scale backers that include the former President of the United States.I’m also deeply unhappy with how my open source code was used to build Minds. I don’t believe its founders to be anti-semites, but I do think that tolerance of this kind of hatred is not anything approaching the virtue that they think it is. While these sorts of hateful ideas can certainly be countered by better ones, it’s also certainly true that alternative social networking sites have been used to plan undemocratic insurrections and hate crimes that led to real harm.Mainstream social networks, particularly Facebook, are not off the hook here: banning anti-semitism does not absolve you of complicity in genocide elsewhere. Twitter also has its fair share of discoverable posts that espouse anti-semitic tropes. But these other networks are remarkable for their concentration: whereas these ideas are a tiny fringe on Facebook and Twitter, they’re how these other networks support themselves. You go to an alt network because you’ve been banned - or you’re worried you will be banned - from a traditional one. This concentration of extremists is why much of the insurrection was able to be openly organized on networks like Gab.The Southern Poverty Law Center noted as such in its The Year in Hate & Extremism Report 2021:Hate groups and other extremists do not solely rely on mainstream social media platforms to spread their message — they are increasingly using “alt-tech” platforms that are often advertised as “free speech” alternatives to places like Twitter and Facebook. On these platforms, users don’t have to worry about content moderation. These include video platforms like Bitchute and Odysee and social media sites like Gab.And there does seem to be a growing, violent movement lurking here. Incidents of antisemitism in America hit an all-time high in 2021. I’m certain that this is in no small part because overtly racist town squares have become easier than ever to be a part of. These networks have millions of users, are growing, encourage real hate crime, and have ringing endorsements from people who have held the highest office in the land. We overlook them as sideshows at our peril."
