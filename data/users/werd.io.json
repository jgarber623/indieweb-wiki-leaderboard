I’m constantly sharing links to stuff I find interesting, but they’ve been buried on my site until <a href=\"https://werd.io/content/all?q=reading%2C+watching\">my end-of-month roundup posts</a>. This change makes them much more prominent. Honestly, the essence of the web is really about linking out to what you find useful or interesting, so this is kind of a return to web basics.</p>\n<p>As a technical by-product, RSS subscribers will also receive these link posts as they’re published. Hopefully that’s not too disruptive.</p>\n<p>I spent a couple of hours making an adjustment to the stock Known template Market Street (which I’ve used on my site for years) in order to allow for more compact posting of notes, links, and photos. The new one’s called Cornmarket Street, after the main shopping street in my hometown, and I like it more than I thought I would. I can easily imagine adding more content types over time: I’ve never posted links to hardware I like, for example, but I’m an unabashed tech nerd, so there might be a place for that. Lately I’ve been loving the <a href=\"https://fujifilm-x.com/en-us/products/cameras/x-t4/\">Fujifilm X-T4</a>, after my friend <a href=\"https://twitter.com/obra\">Jesse Vincent</a> suggested that I wouldn’t regret getting a new camera to capture photos of my baby.

                "value": "I’ve changed my website around to reflect that, at least for the time being, I’m doing more bookmark-saving and posting of short notes than long-form writing.I was actually inspired, of all things, by The Verge redesigning its website to be more blog-like. I’m constantly sharing links to stuff I find interesting, but they’ve been buried on my site until my end-of-month roundup posts. This change makes them much more prominent. Honestly, the essence of the web is really about linking out to what you find useful or interesting, so this is kind of a return to web basics.As a technical by-product, RSS subscribers will also receive these link posts as they’re published. Hopefully that’s not too disruptive.I spent a couple of hours making an adjustment to the stock Known template Market Street (which I’ve used on my site for years) in order to allow for more compact posting of notes, links, and photos. The new one’s called Cornmarket Street, after the main shopping street in my hometown, and I like it more than I thought I would.
