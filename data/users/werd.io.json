Here’s why:</p>\n<p><strong>I don’t think it’s healthy (for me) to be this connected.</strong></p>\n<p>It’s a newsfeed on steroids: a dopamine rush of everything that could possibly be happening. It’s not just a backchannel to life, it’s a backchannel to <em>everybody’s</em> life, including their ids. If something important has happened, it’s there, instantly. If something <em>unimportant</em> has happened, it’s there, instantly. It’s all there, all of the time.</p>\n<p>It’s good to be informed. But when it turns into an addiction - as it has for me, partially because of my own personality traits and partially because of the platform’s design - being informed can turn into a cognitive load that clouds other tasks.</p>\n<p>A timeboxed learning activity - reading a book, checking out my feeds, skimming a newspaper, listening to a podcast, etc - is unambiguously healthy.

I’m not railing against “cancel culture” here - typically, these people deserve some (or quite a bit of) scorn. But I’m not sure I need or want to see the pile-ons, and I worry that the energy devoted to the main character actually hides the activity some of the worst actors in society, who go about their toxic days virtually undetected.</p>\n<p>I have no interest in tone policing the internet, and there’s a lot of excellent work that’s come out of Twitter organizing: I think MeToo and Black Lives Matter are two very clear forces for good that started as hashtags to gather like minds.

Not as such, but I do think my website would have fewer readers to begin with. Twitter is easily my single biggest referrer today. This is another argument for <em>downgrading</em> my involvement rather than disappearing entirely, but I’m hopeful that this dynamic will change.
