This new change - which, let’s be clear, is an experiment - is already a little different.

The mechanics of how it does that are different, though, and worth thinking about in the context of social network design.</p>\n<p><strong>First, the money.</strong></p>\n<p>This is the big carrot for new writers.

Medium’s paywall is leaky, so non-members will be able to read and help to promote it.</p>\n<p>While Medium’s financial model is content-centric, Substack’s is personality-based. Readers opt in to subscribe to a publisher, just as they would any newsletter. But publishers can opt to establish payment tiers that give subscribers access to premium posts if they pay more money. Attention doesn’t come into it: a subscriber either believes you’re worth paying a monthly fee for or they don’t.</p>\n<p>The other trick is that, on Substack, publishers have to sign up separately to Stripe in order to gather payments.

Between Stripe fees and Substack’s 10% take, the publisher is left with a little over 85% of subscription fees - which is a significantly better deal than many places on the web.</p>\n<p>Using revenue as a lens, then, whether you choose Medium or Substack depends on whether you have a following who might pay for your work. If you do great work, or are working on a single, amazing piece of writing, but don’t have a following, Medium is clearly the better choice.
