This is really good for when I’m somewhere new and want to save all the information for later reference but don’t want to let the world know where I am at that moment.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>I can <a href=\"http://indieweb.org/backfeed\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">backfeed</a> posts from Instagram and Facebook, which is better than nothing– I may have a workaround to hydrate posts/create them through IFTTT or Jetpack in theory… Stay tuned.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>\n<strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Keep copies of the media and posts backed up.</span></strong> I’m actually using a managed hosting service that backs everything up to some S3 buckets I had laying around from an old project, but I also use this plug-in that sends everything to my NAS farm here at the house too. From there, it’s backed up to a some more clouds. Can never have enough backup.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>\n<strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Eventually handle <a href=\"http://jason.gatewood.xyz/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">my main site’s</a> duties.</span></strong> Right now that website shows off my professional side as a journalist/technical writer; I need to migrate all that over here and figure out how I’m gonna handle the URL… Overlay or redirect or… Let me know any other ideas!</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Look good doing all that!</strong></span> I still don’t know if I’m keeping this theme yet. Even if I do, I need to change a lot in the CSS. I want a more minimalist aesthetic:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>only system fonts, so you’re not waiting for a .ttf of a font you’ll never use other than to see my site to download.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>Only Unicode glyphs including using emoji for icon packs (although the icons here are pretty light, I just prefer the aesthetics. I’d also have to get rid of WordPress’ use of <a href=\"https://twemoji.twitter.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://twemoji.twitter.com\">Twimoji</a> maybe. 🤔) There’s plug ins for this though…</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>Redo the .css so there’s less negative space. I love this layout, but want it to be more compact. Also want to switch up the fonts– I like san-serifs to read the body of a post probably due to me spending eons of time in the terminal (preferably monospace ones because 私時々日本語で説明ため入力し and Japanese is always monospaced so it flows better)</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>Would be nice if this site looked good in <a href=\"https://w3m.sourceforge.net/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://w3m.sourceforge.net/\">w3m</a>/<a href=\"http://brow.sh/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">browsh</a> text browsers, as well as feed readers, read-it-later bookmarking apps and so on.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>\n<strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Serve as a feed reader.</span></strong> Since this is already effectively an ActivityWeb instance, part of the how I follow others from here is thru a plugin called <a href=\"https://github.com/akirk/friends\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://github.com/akirk/friends\">Friends</a>, but it’s kinda heavy. Maybe <a href=\"http://github.com/jackjamieson2/yarns-microsub-server\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"github.com/jackjamieson2/yarns-microsub-server\">Yarn</a> is the way to go; both are RSS feed readers but only Friends actually sends a “following” <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/activitypub\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://indieweb.org/activitypub\">webmention</a>/<a href=\"https://indieweb.org/activitypub\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://indieweb.org/activitypub\">activitypub </a>notice to the site/person being followed and lets them know they’re now being followed by me. I think <a href=\"https://david.shanske.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://david.shanske.com\">David Shanske</a> is thinking of adding that ability to Yarn though which would allow for some fun things via <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/microsub\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">microsub</a> too.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-markdown\">\r\n<p>As it is now, it seems to be doing most of the above and just needs a few more cosmetics at this point in the way of organization, taxonomy of posts and workflow practice. Other itches needing scratching are:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>In particular I want to replace/augment my <a href=\"http://instagram.com/starrwulfe\">Instagram</a> with Pixelfed (https://pixelfed.social/starrwulfe) and need to figure out how to connect them. Maybe through my blog?)</li>\r\n<li>Get check-ins and weather reporting right. That’s definitely a <a href=\"https://david.shanske.com/\">David Shanske</a> question.</li>\r\n<li>Make a calendar for RSVP/scheduling that can read iCalendar streams.</li>\r\n<li>Podcasting/Video streaming.

                    "value": "I managed to get the site itself up and running without a ton of hitches and it seems to be humming along well with most of the full requirements installed/coded in/shade-tree-jerry-rigged in.To recap, this site has to:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nserve as a digital garden; where I collect a lot of the things I learn online in one place (this also means some of that stuff YOU can’t see, but I as a logged in user, can.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nserve as my social media hub. Anything I post, like, favorite, etc, should be catalogued here.\r\n\r\nI have a way now to post/like/repost (even quote post) and more to Mastodon (this site IS a Mastodon/ActivityWeb compatible site; try looking up @starrwulfe@starrwulfe.xyz from your account in the Fediverse!)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI can do the same to Twitter as well as Reddit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI can comment, star and follow Github issues and projects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI can check-in to places with Swarm and have it save privately here. This is really good for when I’m somewhere new and want to save all the information for later reference but don’t want to let the world know where I am at that moment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI can backfeed posts from Instagram and Facebook, which is better than nothing– I may have a workaround to hydrate posts/create them through IFTTT or Jetpack in theory… Stay tuned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKeep copies of the media and posts backed up. I’m actually using a managed hosting service that backs everything up to some S3 buckets I had laying around from an old project, but I also use this plug-in that sends everything to my NAS farm here at the house too. From there, it’s backed up to a some more clouds. Can never have enough backup.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEventually handle my main site’s duties. Right now that website shows off my professional side as a journalist/technical writer; I need to migrate all that over here and figure out how I’m gonna handle the URL… Overlay or redirect or… Let me know any other ideas!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLook good doing all that! I still don’t know if I’m keeping this theme yet. Even if I do, I need to change a lot in the CSS. I want a more minimalist aesthetic:\r\n\r\nonly system fonts, so you’re not waiting for a .ttf of a font you’ll never use other than to see my site to download.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOnly Unicode glyphs including using emoji for icon packs (although the icons here are pretty light, I just prefer the aesthetics. I’d also have to get rid of WordPress’ use of Twimoji maybe. 🤔) There’s plug ins for this though…\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRedo the .css so there’s less negative space. I love this layout, but want it to be more compact. Also want to switch up the fonts– I like san-serifs to read the body of a post probably due to me spending eons of time in the terminal (preferably monospace ones because 私時々日本語で説明ため入力し and Japanese is always monospaced so it flows better)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWould be nice if this site looked good in w3m/browsh text browsers, as well as feed readers, read-it-later bookmarking apps and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nServe as a feed reader. Since this is already effectively an ActivityWeb instance, part of the how I follow others from here is thru a plugin called Friends, but it’s kinda heavy. Maybe Yarn is the way to go; both are RSS feed readers but only Friends actually sends a “following” webmention/activitypub notice to the site/person being followed and lets them know they’re now being followed by me. I think David Shanske is thinking of adding that ability to Yarn though which would allow for some fun things via microsub too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs it is now, it seems to be doing most of the above and just needs a few more cosmetics at this point in the way of organization, taxonomy of posts and workflow practice. Other itches needing scratching are:\r\n\r\nIn particular I want to replace/augment my Instagram with Pixelfed (https://pixelfed.social/starrwulfe) and need to figure out how to connect them. Maybe through my blog?)\r\nGet check-ins and weather reporting right. That’s definitely a David Shanske question.\r\nMake a calendar for RSVP/scheduling that can read iCalendar streams.\r\nPodcasting/Video streaming. There’s probably a plug in for that.\r\nBooks/Games/TV/Movies section that will replace GoodReads, LetterBoxd, and other media listing apps.\r\n\r\nIf you’re also “doing too much” with your website and know of some ways to do some of the above or know something else I don’t, send me a webmention/toot/tweet to this page! And if you happened to wander by here and just wanna say hi, you can always use Comment Parade and leave a quick message here as well."
