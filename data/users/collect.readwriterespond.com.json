However, with the passing of the queen and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/sep/11/australia-to-have-public-holiday-to-mark-the-death-of-queen-elizabeth-ii-anthony-albanese-announces\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">additional public holiday</a> we decided to make the most of the situation and go on a driving holiday to Albury.\n<p>It is always funny how you assume certain things based on past experiences. When we arrived after driving all day we assumed we would easily be able to get into somewhere to celebrate our anniversary, but we quickly realised that even mid-week a walk-up was not a guarantee. After wandering the streets for a while we stumbled upon the <a href=\"https://publichousealbury.com.au/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Public House</a>. It is funny how with all the searching online, serendipity still has a place. The place pleased all, with my wife and I sharing a mini cocktail or two, while our children loved colouring in the children’s menus and completing the various activities provided. Oh, and the food was great.</p>\n<p>We chose to stay in Albury as it not only provided a range of activities, but a great launching spot for the wider area. One place we were keen to visit was Beechworth. I always find it interesting to visit a place twice. Sometimes the memory does not necessarily match with how it actually is. I have some history with the area, with my wife and I having in Beechworth in 2009, while I also went on school camp there many years ago.</p>\n<p>Visiting with our children, we went to <a href=\"https://www.beechworthhoney.com.au/visit-us/the-honey-shop/\">Beechworth Honey</a>, where the girls got to taste different types of honey and learn about the process involved in producing them. We then went to the original <a href=\"https://www.beechworthbakery.com.au/location-beechworth\">Beechworth Bakery</a> and had a pie and a bee sting. After that we walked across town to <a href=\"https://billsons.com.au/brewery\">Billson Brewery</a>. Not sure I remember visiting this space in the past.  It was a good place to visit with the children as they got to try the various flavours of cordial, while my wife and I were able to try the various gins and liqueurs. It was also nice to buy some bottles of <a href=\"https://billsons.com.au/shop/p/chilli-punch-cordial\">Chilli Punch Cordial</a>, although I now realise that I could have ordered them from Billson online, it just never occurred to me. On our way back to Albury we took a detour and climbed to the top of <a href=\"https://www.parks.vic.gov.au/places-to-see/sites/mt-pilot-summit\">Mt Pilot</a>.

This included spending time at the <a href=\"https://www.alburycity.nsw.gov.au/leisure/parks-and-public-spaces/botanic-gardens/gardens-and-collections/childrens-garden\">children’s garden in the Albury Botanical Garden</a>.

A couple of highlights were <a href=\"https://www.stephenjbush.com/portfolio-items/1300/\">Stephen Bush’s Babar inspired The Lure of Paris #35</a>, <a href=\"https://collection.moadoph.gov.au/objects/2013-0435/\">Kevin Gilbert’s Colonising Species</a> and the kids space.</p>\n<p>Sadly the night ended on a sour note as we were evacuated from our hotel at 3am in the morning.

                "value": "Prior to COVID, we had a tradition as a family to go on a big holiday each September. We had not really planned to go away this year. However, with the passing of the queen and the additional public holiday we decided to make the most of the situation and go on a driving holiday to Albury.\nIt is always funny how you assume certain things based on past experiences. When we arrived after driving all day we assumed we would easily be able to get into somewhere to celebrate our anniversary, but we quickly realised that even mid-week a walk-up was not a guarantee. After wandering the streets for a while we stumbled upon the Public House. It is funny how with all the searching online, serendipity still has a place. The place pleased all, with my wife and I sharing a mini cocktail or two, while our children loved colouring in the children’s menus and completing the various activities provided. Oh, and the food was great.\nWe chose to stay in Albury as it not only provided a range of activities, but a great launching spot for the wider area. One place we were keen to visit was Beechworth.
