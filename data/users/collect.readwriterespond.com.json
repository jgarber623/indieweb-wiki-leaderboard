When I started to think about the work that would grow into <em>Midnight’s Children</em>, I looked again at the great Russian novels of the 19th century, <em>Crime and Punishment</em>,<em> Anna Karenina</em>, <em>Dead Souls</em>, books of the type that Henry James had called “large, loose, baggy monsters,” large-scale realist novels—though, in the case of <em>Dead Souls</em>, on the very edge of surrealism. And at the great English novels of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, <em>Tristram Shandy</em> (wildly innovative and by no means realist), <em>Vanity Fair</em> (bristling with sharp knives of satire), <em>Little Dorrit</em> (in which the Circumlocution Office, a government department whose purpose is to do nothing, comes close to magic realism), and <em>Bleak House</em> (in which the interminable court case Jarndyce v Jarndyce comes even closer). And at their great French precursor, Gargantua and Pantagruel, which is completely fabulist. I also had in mind the modern counterparts of these masterpieces, <em>The Tin Drum</em> and <em>One Hundred Years of Solitude</em>, <em>The Adventures of Augie March</em> and <em>Catch-22</em>, and the rich, expansive worlds of Iris Murdoch and Doris Lessing (both too prolific to be defined by any single title, but Murdoch’s <em>The Black Prince</em> and Lessing’s T<em>he Making of the Representative from Planet 8</em> have stayed with me).</p>\n<footer>@lithub<cite> <a href=\"https://lithub.com/bollywood-or-bust-salman-rushdie-on-the-world-of-midnights-children-forty-years-later-2/\">https://lithub.com/bollywood-or-bust-salman-rushdie-on-the-world-of-midnights-children-forty-years-later-2/</a></cite></footer>\n</blockquote>\n<p><script note=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Blogger-Peer-Review/quotebacks@1/quoteback.js\"></script></p>\n<p>Personally, I would love to know the process Rushdie used to write such an intricate novel.

                "value": "I remember reading Salman Rushdie’s Midnight’s Children when I was younger. Although I felt I appreciated Rushdie for his skill and style, I think I got lost in awe of the complexity. Recently returning to the novel at a different age, through a different medium – audiobook – I was still in awe, but I also felt that I appreciated it all a bit more (well at least I think I did.) I wonder if my original experience was based on trying to consume the text instead of letting the waves just wash over you? I was also surprised how well the novel lent itself to being read aloud.\nStylistically, the intertwining of the seemingly local within history reminded of Tim Winton’s Cloudstreet. However, I am not sure Cloudstreet is an example of what Linda Hutcheon’s calls ‘historiographic metafiction’.\n\nAccording to Hutcheon, in “A Poetics of Postmodernism”, works of historiographic metafiction are “those well-known and popular novels which are both intensely self-reflexive and yet paradoxically also lay claim to historical events and personages”.[3]\n https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historiographic_metafiction\n\n\nIt was interesting to read Rushdie’s reflection on what he was attempting with the novel.\n\nAs a reader, I have always been attracted to capacious, large-hearted fictions, books that try to gather up large armfuls of the world. When I started to think about the work that would grow into Midnight’s Children, I looked again at the great Russian novels of the 19th century, Crime and Punishment, Anna Karenina, Dead Souls, books of the type that Henry James had called “large, loose, baggy monsters,” large-scale realist novels—though, in the case of Dead Souls, on the very edge of surrealism. And at the great English novels of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, Tristram Shandy (wildly innovative and by no means realist), Vanity Fair (bristling with sharp knives of satire), Little Dorrit (in which the Circumlocution Office, a government department whose purpose is to do nothing, comes close to magic realism), and Bleak House (in which the interminable court case Jarndyce v Jarndyce comes even closer). And at their great French precursor, Gargantua and Pantagruel, which is completely fabulist. I also had in mind the modern counterparts of these masterpieces, The Tin Drum and One Hundred Years of Solitude, The Adventures of Augie March and Catch-22, and the rich, expansive worlds of Iris Murdoch and Doris Lessing (both too prolific to be defined by any single title, but Murdoch’s The Black Prince and Lessing’s The Making of the Representative from Planet 8 have stayed with me).\n@lithub https://lithub.com/bollywood-or-bust-salman-rushdie-on-the-world-of-midnights-children-forty-years-later-2/\n\n\nPersonally, I would love to know the process Rushdie used to write such an intricate novel.

The new manager at work ran a 10 hour charity music conference in his spare time. I am often happy if I have done the washing and got food on the table, I clearly need to work harder on my pitch.\nOn the family front, we went on our first holiday post-COVID to country Victoria. It was interesting returning to various places with children. I think it is fair to say wine tasting and children do not always match.\nPersonally, I finally got around to loading Linux on my old Macbook Pro and Chromebook. Other than the ability to run music applications, I am pretty happy and not missing a think. I continued my dive back into books listening to Thomas More’s Utopia, Liu Cixin’s The Three-Body Problem and Sylvia Plath’s The Bell Jar. I also nostalgically binged The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance. (Was this really made for children?) In regards to music, Montaigne’s Making It has been on repeat.\nHere then are some of the other dots that have had me thinking:\nEducation\nThe Tricky Ethics of Being a Teacher on TikTok\nAmelia Tate considers the place of TikTok in the classroom.
