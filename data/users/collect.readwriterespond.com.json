What was interesting is the way in which Fred Gibson continually captures video of his experiences and how he <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2I6V0NlaHg\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">incorporates this into his performances</a>. I loved his use of his <a href=\"https://www.native-instruments.com/en/products/maschine/production-systems/maschine/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Maschine</a>. This desire to move away from the dependency on the computer reminded me of <a href=\"https://collect.readwriterespond.com/mc-101-and-ms-1/\" title=\"MC-101 and MS-1\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">James Blake’s focus on hardware when playing live</a>. See his short <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3G27XxE3HA\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">demonstration for Zane Lowe</a> for example. Yet at the same time this ability is balanced with a deep knowledge of music.

                "value": "I stumbled upon Fred Again last year. I was fascinated in the use of seemingly real-life samples to capture the world. What was interesting is the way in which Fred Gibson continually captures video of his experiences and how he incorporates this into his performances. I loved his use of his Maschine. This desire to move away from the dependency on the computer reminded me of James Blake’s focus on hardware when playing live. See his short demonstration for Zane Lowe for example.
