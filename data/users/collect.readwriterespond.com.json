Koenig talks about new suspects, the withholding of evidence and lose of other evidence.\n<blockquote class=\"quoteback\" darkmode=\"\" data-title=\"Why%20Adnan%20Syed%20Was%20Released%20From%20Prison\" data-author=\"@nytimes\" cite=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/20/podcasts/the-daily/adnan-syed-serial-conviction-overturned.html\">\n<p class=\"css-8hvvyd\">So that’s the bulk of the state’s motion to vacate — new information about two potential suspects, important evidence withheld from the defense, renewed suspicion of Jay’s story, loss of confidence in the cellphone evidence. And while the Brady violation alone is enough for the state to cry uncle, all of it together, well, yes, overwhelming cause for concern. Adnan’s case was a mess, is a mess.
