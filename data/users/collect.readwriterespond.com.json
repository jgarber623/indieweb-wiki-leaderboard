Personally, I have been a literally quieter this month, as I lost my voice. This is a bit of a problem when working in support. In part I returned from illness earlier than I probably should have and subsequently copped something on the rebound. What was interesting is that I had a dry irritating cough which meant I was unable to sit down for long without having a coughing fit. Actually, I could not even look down. This meant that as much as I wanted, I was unable to do any work. One of the positives was that I was that I felt best when walking and not talking.</p>\n<p>The winner of the walking was the dog that we are currently dog-sitting. I have not lived with a dog since I was a child. It has definitely given me a <a href=\"https://readwriterespond.com/2018/07/my-life-in-black-and-white/\">different perspective on things</a>. Firstly, I cannot believe how many people seem to throw away their fast food fries. Secondly, I cannot remember being so conscious of poo and whether we have been overfeeding. The other interesting thing was how much more exercise we have done as there is someone else involved.</p>\n<p>On the Work front, I have been spending time trying to get to the bottom of ongoing issues. This led to using Google Sheets to create a template for filtering errors by school making it easier to email out issues.</p>\n<p>Personally, with all my walking I have really dived back into books, listening to Tim Winton‚Äôs <a href=\"https://collect.readwriterespond.com/cloudstreet-tim-winton/\">Cloudstreet</a> and <a href=\"https://collect.readwriterespond.com/dirt-music-tim-winton/\">Dirt Music</a>, Christos Tsiolkas‚Äô <a href=\"https://collect.readwriterespond.com/barracuda-christos-tsiolkas/\">Barracuda</a>, as well as Dave Eggers‚Äô <a href=\"https://collect.readwriterespond.com/%f0%9f%93%9a-the-every-dave-eggers/\">The Every</a>. I also watched <a href=\"https://collect.readwriterespond.com/the-umbrella-academy/\">The Umbrella Academy</a>, <a href=\"https://collect.readwriterespond.com/squid-game/\">Squid Game</a> and the latest Predator instalment, <a href=\"https://collect.readwriterespond.com/prey/\">Prey</a>.

                "value": "Life certainly has a way of teaching you lessons. Personally, I have been a literally quieter this month, as I lost my voice. This is a bit of a problem when working in support. In part I returned from illness earlier than I probably should have and subsequently copped something on the rebound. What was interesting is that I had a dry irritating cough which meant I was unable to sit down for long without having a coughing fit. Actually, I could not even look down. This meant that as much as I wanted, I was unable to do any work. One of the positives was that I was that I felt best when walking and not talking.\nThe winner of the walking was the dog that we are currently dog-sitting. I have not lived with a dog since I was a child. It has definitely given me a different perspective on things. Firstly, I cannot believe how many people seem to throw away their fast food fries. Secondly, I cannot remember being so conscious of poo and whether we have been overfeeding. The other interesting thing was how much more exercise we have done as there is someone else involved.\nOn the Work front, I have been spending time trying to get to the bottom of ongoing issues. This led to using Google Sheets to create a template for filtering errors by school making it easier to email out issues.\nPersonally, with all my walking I have really dived back into books, listening to Tim Winton‚Äôs Cloudstreet and Dirt Music, Christos Tsiolkas‚Äô Barracuda, as well as Dave Eggers‚Äô The Every. I also watched The Umbrella Academy, Squid Game and the latest Predator instalment, Prey. While in regards to music, I enjoyed Stella Donnelly‚Äôs Flood and Hot Chip‚Äôs Freakout/Release.\nHere then are some of the posts that have had me thinking:\nEducation\nEssential Tools for Teaching?\nMiguel Guhlin reflects on the process of selecting the right tool for teaching.\nShould we be wary of so-called coaches?

The gap between our ideals and our experience at work is too great for us to bear. That means, if we want to halt the burnout epidemic, we need to close the gap, both by improving working conditions and lowering our ideals. Because our burnout culture results as much from our ideas as from the concrete facts of our jobs, we will need different ethical and spiritual expectations for work as much as we will need better pay, schedules, and support. In fact, we will need a new set of ideals to guide us as we construct those conditions.</p>\n<footer><cite> <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/religion/jonathan-malesic-vision-of-life-beyond-burnout/14039320\">https://www.abc.net.au/religion/jonathan-malesic-vision-of-life-beyond-burnout/14039320</a></cite></footer>\n</blockquote>\n<p><script note=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Blogger-Peer-Review/quotebacks@1/quoteback.js\"></script></p>\n<p>Referring to the work of Henry David Thoreau, Malesic talks about the importance of genius.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"quoteback\" cite=\"https://www.abc.net.au/religion/jonathan-malesic-vision-of-life-beyond-burnout/14039320\" data-title=\"A%20vision%20of%20life%20beyond%20burnout\" data-author=\"\">\n<p>We have all read the standard advice on business and wellness websites for how to prevent or heal your burnout.

Organise your tasks by urgency and importance. Meditate. These are all basically superstitions: individual, symbolic actions that are disconnected from burnout‚Äôs real causes. Our workplaces and cultural ideals contribute more to our burnout than our personal organisation methods do. Still, individuals are not powerless in the face of burnout.

                "value": "In an excerpt from The End of Burnout: Why Work Drains Us and How to Build Better Lives, Jonathan Malesic suggests that the answer for burnout relates to moving dignity back to the individual rather than being dependent on work.\nSo many workers are at risk for burnout because the degraded reality of our jobs since the 1970s coincides with a too-lofty ideal of work. The gap between our ideals and our experience at work is too great for us to bear. That means, if we want to halt the burnout epidemic, we need to close the gap, both by improving working conditions and lowering our ideals. Because our burnout culture results as much from our ideas as from the concrete facts of our jobs, we will need different ethical and spiritual expectations for work as much as we will need better pay, schedules, and support. In fact, we will need a new set of ideals to guide us as we construct those conditions.\n https://www.abc.net.au/religion/jonathan-malesic-vision-of-life-beyond-burnout/14039320\n\n\nReferring to the work of Henry David Thoreau, Malesic talks about the importance of genius.\nWe have all read the standard advice on business and wellness websites for how to prevent or heal your burnout. Get more sleep. Learn to say no. Organise your tasks by urgency and importance. Meditate. These are all basically superstitions: individual, symbolic actions that are disconnected from burnout‚Äôs real causes. Our workplaces and cultural ideals contribute more to our burnout than our personal organisation methods do. Still, individuals are not powerless in the face of burnout. We do have a role to play in aligning our ideals with our reality at work. And Thoreau, the individualist who preached self-reliance, can help us identify it.\n‚Ä¶\nToo much work and too little autonomy contribute to burnout; Thoreau‚Äôs program limits work in order to foster self-determination. Thoreau‚Äôs individualistic streak means he undervalues community. But he wants to create conditions in which people who recognise their own dignity can follow their genius and thus perform a higher labour: to harmonise themselves with their supreme sense of value.\n https://www.abc.net.au/religion/jonathan-malesic-vision-of-life-beyond-burnout/14039320\n\n\nThis reminds me of John Spencer‚Äôs discussion of personal genius hour.
