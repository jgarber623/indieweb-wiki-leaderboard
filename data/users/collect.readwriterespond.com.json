It was interesting returning to various places with children. I think it is fair to say wine tasting and children do not always match.\nPersonally, I finally got around to loading Linux on my old Macbook Pro and Chromebook. Other than the ability to run music applications, I am pretty happy and not missing a think. I continued my dive back into books listening to Thomas More’s Utopia, Liu Cixin’s The Three-Body Problem and Sylvia Plath’s The Bell Jar. I also nostalgically binged The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance. (Was this really made for children?) In regards to music, Montaigne’s Making It has been on repeat.\nHere then are some of the other dots that have had me thinking:\nEducation\nThe Tricky Ethics of Being a Teacher on TikTok\nAmelia Tate considers the place of TikTok in the classroom. She discusses the trend of content created about and even with students.\nThe Enduring Allure of Choose Your Own Adventure Books\nLeslie Jamison dives back into the world of the Choose Your Own Adventure book series.\nUnbeaching the whale – The education revolution failed — and so did its way of thinking\nDean Ashenden reflects on the failure of Gonski and the education revolution.\nTimetable Absurdity\nCameron Paterson discusses the way in which schools are still held hostage by the timetable.\nI want, I wish, I hope, I dream\nDavid Truss shares an activity where he creates a portrait wall with a want, a wish, a hope or a dream underneath it.\nTechnology\nAfter Self-Hosting My Email for Twenty-Three Years, I have Thrown In the Towel. The Oligopoloy has Won.\nCarlos Fenollosa reflects on the demise of self-hosted email. One of the main reasons he argues for the failure is the crude blacklisting of large swaths of email, rather than a penalty process.\nWe Spoke With the Last Person Standing in the Floppy Disk Business\nNiek Hilkmann and Thomas Walskaar interview Tom Persky about the dying art of maintaining floppy disks.\nInteroperable Facebook\nCory Doctorow unpacks how an interoperable Facebook might work.\nTech Fear-Mongering Isn’t New—But It’s Time to Break the Cycle\nJason Feifer provides insight into Amy Orben’s four-step Sisyphean cycle of technology panics.\nWe need to deal with data privacy in our classrooms\nBonnie Stewart reflects upon the online learning with the return to the classroom in a post-COVID world.\nAI’s dark arts come into their own\nAlex Hern discusses the dark-side to the magic of artificial intelligence.\nGeneral\nElectric Bike, Stupid Love of My Life\nCraig Mod shares his passion for electric bikes.\nAfter Queen Elizabeth II’s death, Indigenous Australia can’t be expected to shut up. Our sorry business is without end\nWith the passing of Queen Elizabeth, Stan Grant considers legacy of colonisation for indigenous people around the world.\nMusic on the brain: Listening can influence our brain’s activity\nAbdullah Iqbal unpacks some of the research into the benefits of music on the brain.\nArk Head\nIn order to survived the battered psyche, Venkatesh Rao explains that way have resorted to the ‘ark head’ mental model. This involves giving up on solving the world’s ills and simply hiding in our ark.\nThe credibility of science is damaged when universities brag about themselves\nAdrian Lenardic and Johnny Seales argue that the rewarding of attention economy has corrupted scientific research.\nFlorence Nightingale Was Born 197 Years Ago, and Her Infographics Were Better Than Most of the Internet’s\nCelebrating the birth of , Cara Giaimo discusses Florence Nightingale’s impact in regards to the spread of ideas, not just as the ‘Lady with the Lamp’.\nRead Write Respond #080\nSo that was September for me, how about you? As always, hope you are safe and well.\n  Image by Bryan Mathers\n "
