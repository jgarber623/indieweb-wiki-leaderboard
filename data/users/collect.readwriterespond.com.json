These different conceptions mark the boundaries of the culture wars currently being played out in British politics and society.\nDoug Belshaw https://thoughtshrapnel.com/2021/08/17/culture-is-in-a-state-of-constant-flux/\n\n\nRaymond Williams suggests that culture fluctuates between dominant, residual and emergent:\nBy ’emergent’ I mean, first, that new meanings and values, new practices, new relationships and kinds of relationship are continually being created. But it is exceptionally difficult to distinguish between those which are really elements of some new phase of the dominant culture (and in this sense ‘species-specific’) and those which are substantially alternative or oppositional to it: emergent in the strict sense, rather than merely novel.\n https://theoria.art-zoo.com/dominant-residual-and-emergent-raymond-williams/\n\n\nJulian Stodd suggests the one word to describe ‘culture’ is violence:\n\nIf we had to choose a single word to describe culture, it would possibly be ‘violence’, not because the behaviours of culture are violent (although they may be), but rather because culture is held as a struggle at the intersection of systems. Tribal systems, formal systems, belief systems, knowledge systems, and specifically systems of power.\n@julianstodd https://julianstodd.wordpress.com/2022/09/06/culture/"

Probably half of the air fleet in the world today is more than 20 years old and still uses floppy disks in some of the avionics. That’s a huge consumer. There’s also medical equipment, which requires floppy disks to get the information in and out of medical devices. The biggest customer of all is probably the embroidery business though. Thousands and thousands of machines that use floppy disks were made for this, and they still use these.

One of the main reasons he argues for the failure is the crude blacklisting of large swaths of email, rather than a penalty process.\n<blockquote class=\"quoteback\" darkmode=\"\" data-title=\"After%20self-hosting%20my%20email%20for%20twenty-three%20years%20I%20have%20thrown%20in%20the%20towel.%20The%20oligopoly%20has%20won.\" data-author=\"@cfenollosa\" cite=\"https://cfenollosa.com/blog/after-self-hosting-my-email-for-twenty-three-years-i-have-thrown-in-the-towel-the-oligopoly-has-won.html\">\n<p>I’m not asking for a revolution. Please hear my simple proposal out:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Let’s keep antispam measures.</strong> Of course. Continue using filters and crowdsourced/AI signals to reinforce the outputs of those algorithms.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Change blacklisting protocols so they are not permanent and use an exponential cooldown penalty.</strong> After spam is detected from an IP, it should be banned for, say, ten minutes. Then, a day. A week. A month, and so on. This discourages spammers from reusing IPs after the ban is lifted and will allow the IP pool to be cleaned over time by legitimate owners.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Blacklists should not include whole IP blocks.</strong> I am not responsible for what my IP neighbor is doing with their server.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Stop blackholing.</strong> No need to bounce every email, which adds overhead, but please send a daily notification to postmaster alerting them.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>There should be a recourse for legitimate servers.</strong> I’m not asking for a blank check. I don’t mind doing some paperwork or paying a fee to prove I’m legit. Spammers will not do that, and if they do, they will get blacklisted anyways after sending more spam. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>These changes are very minor, they mostly keep the status quo, and have almost no cost.

                "value": "Carlos Fenollosa reflects on the demise of self-hosted email. One of the main reasons he argues for the failure is the crude blacklisting of large swaths of email, rather than a penalty process.\n\nI’m not asking for a revolution. Please hear my simple proposal out:\n\nLet’s keep antispam measures. Of course. Continue using filters and crowdsourced/AI signals to reinforce the outputs of those algorithms.\nChange blacklisting protocols so they are not permanent and use an exponential cooldown penalty. After spam is detected from an IP, it should be banned for, say, ten minutes. Then, a day. A week. A month, and so on. This discourages spammers from reusing IPs after the ban is lifted and will allow the IP pool to be cleaned over time by legitimate owners.\nBlacklists should not include whole IP blocks. I am not responsible for what my IP neighbor is doing with their server.\nStop blackholing. No need to bounce every email, which adds overhead, but please send a daily notification to postmaster alerting them.\nThere should be a recourse for legitimate servers. I’m not asking for a blank check. I don’t mind doing some paperwork or paying a fee to prove I’m legit. Spammers will not do that, and if they do, they will get blacklisted anyways after sending more spam. \n\nThese changes are very minor, they mostly keep the status quo, and have almost no cost.
