                "html": "Prior to COVID, we had a tradition as a family to go on a big holiday each September. We had not really planned to go away this year. However, with the passing of the queen and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/sep/11/australia-to-have-public-holiday-to-mark-the-death-of-queen-elizabeth-ii-anthony-albanese-announces\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">additional public holiday</a> we decided to make the most of the situation and go on a driving holiday to Albury.\n<p>It is always funny how you assume certain things based on past experiences. When we arrived after driving all day we assumed we would easily be able to get into somewhere to celebrate our anniversary, but we quickly realised that even mid-week a walk-up was not a guarantee. After wandering the streets for a while we stumbled upon the <a href=\"https://publichousealbury.com.au/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Public House</a>. It is funny how with all the searching online, serendipity still has a place. The place pleased all, with my wife and I sharing a mini cocktail or two, while our children loved colouring in the children’s menus and completing the various activities provided. Oh, and the food was great.</p>\n<p>We chose to stay in Albury as it not only provided a range of activities, but a great launching spot for the wider area. One place we were keen to visit was Beechworth. I always find it interesting to visit a place twice. Sometimes the memory does not necessarily match with how it actually is. I have some history with the area, with my wife and I having in Beechworth in 2009, while I also went on school camp there many years ago.</p>\n<p>Visiting with our children, we went to <a href=\"https://www.beechworthhoney.com.au/visit-us/the-honey-shop/\">Beechworth Honey</a>, where the girls got to taste different types of honey and learn about the process involved in producing them. We then went to the original <a href=\"https://www.beechworthbakery.com.au/location-beechworth\">Beechworth Bakery</a> and had a pie and a bee sting. After that we walked across town to <a href=\"https://billsons.com.au/brewery\">Billson Brewery</a>. Not sure I remember visiting this space in the past.  It was a good place to visit with the children as they got to try the various flavours of cordial, while my wife and I were able to try the various gins and liqueurs. It was also nice to buy some bottles of <a href=\"https://billsons.com.au/shop/p/chilli-punch-cordial\">Chilli Punch Cordial</a>, although I now realise that I could have ordered them from Billson online, it just never occurred to me. On our way back to Albury we took a detour and climbed to the top of <a href=\"https://www.parks.vic.gov.au/places-to-see/sites/mt-pilot-summit\">Mt Pilot</a>. A reminder I should do more bush walks with my children.</p>\n<p>For diner we went back to Public House for 2 for 1 pizzas. Funny thing was that we got rained on as the retractable roof was left open.</p>\n<p>On Friday, we explored Albury. This included spending time at the <a href=\"https://www.alburycity.nsw.gov.au/leisure/parks-and-public-spaces/botanic-gardens/gardens-and-collections/childrens-garden\">children’s garden in the Albury Botanical Garden</a>. We then visited the <a href=\"https://www.mamalbury.com.au/\">Murray Art Museum Albury</a>. A couple of highlights were <a href=\"https://www.stephenjbush.com/portfolio-items/1300/\">Stephen Bush’s Babar inspired The Lure of Paris #35</a>, <a href=\"https://collection.moadoph.gov.au/objects/2013-0435/\">Kevin Gilbert’s Colonising Species</a> and the kids space.</p>\n<p>Sadly the night ended on a sour note as we were evacuated from our hotel at 3am in the morning. Thankfully it was <a href=\"https://www.news.com.au/technology/environment/wild-spring-weather-continues-to-hit-as-authorities-monitor-flood-risks/news-story/23c0611ad32039280963eae14809e564\">not raining outside</a> as we wait to be told we could return to our rooms. I guess it could have been worse, we could have been evacuated <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/emergency/warning/df7b0bd8-3d53-11ed-b83a-0a58012cdf60\">due to flooding</a> or worse, because we were under attack.

                "value": "Dean Ashenden reflects on the failure of Gonski and the education revolution. He suggests that the biggest ‘success’ was the way of talking about education which focuses on outcomes:\nThe revolution’s one real success was in directing the attention and shaping the language of “policymakers” and “thought leaders.” They now have no other way of thinking and talking about schooling. Hence ministers declaring that yet another bad PISA result to be yet another “wake-up call,” hence more announcements about lifting teachers’ pay or entry scores, hence new tests to make sure that teachers can spell, and hence more looking at other countries to see what they are doing right that might work here — all less from conviction than from not knowing what else to do. Seen from the outside it comes close to a famous definition of insanity.\nAdministrator https://insidestory.org.au/unbeaching-the-whale/\n\n\nAs a model, the notion of outcomes comes from health services. Ashenden posits that this is problematic as those doing the ‘working’ are in fact the students, not the teachers.\nThe most fundamental mistake lies in imagining that schools are essentially deliverers of the service of teaching in much the same way that hospitals and clinics deliver health services. In reality, schools aren’t like that at all.\nSchools are sites of the production of learning, not by teachers but by a four million–strong workforce otherwise known as students. The big determinant of their productivity is not the quality of supervision but the organisation of their work.\nAdministrator https://insidestory.org.au/unbeaching-the-whale/\n\n\nAs much as I agree with what Ashenden is saying, my fear is that we are all always already ‘inside the box’?
