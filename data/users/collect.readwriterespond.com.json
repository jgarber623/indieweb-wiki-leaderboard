Magnus about his book <a href=\"https://books.openbookpublishers.com/10.11647/obp.0293.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">A Philosophy of Covers Songs</a>. Throughout, they explore various aspects associated with cover songs. The way often start as cover bands, at the very least starting as a fan. The history of covers, including the notion of ‘coverage’ and playing the music people wanted to hear, as well as covering/hiding over other artists, making black artists white. The choice between a straight note for note cover versus a rendition, with the challenge as to change and what to keep. Extending from this, the cover can serve as a meditation on the original or even an answer, which is the case with Aretha Franklin’s cover of Otis Readings Respect.
