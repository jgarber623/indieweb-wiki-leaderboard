              "#meditationGood session. Felt the \"Aşia\" part as strong waves of energy through my back and neck mainly. Personally focused on removing self-judgement & judgement of others. Actually felt like something was lifted out of me. I intend to re-do this session to seal the deal :P‍On another note, this was not a deep or medium trans session. I was awake and talked quite a lot during this session; not like mind chatter but more like purposeful interaction and inner repetition of certain constructed sentences, like \"I choose not to judge myself anymore.\"‍After the session, as I type these post, I feel calm, peaceful and more intone with myself.‍Also, I suspect that the green & purple lines tend to get on top of each other as the trans state becomes deeper. We'll see as I record more sessions in another now.‍\"The time collapses into now\" // \"no mind no time\" // \"Only now exists\"nootropics:, October 25, 2022 1:43 PM"

I first tried google-drive public folders, it works, but the url structure is too cumbersome. I need to get the image ID and put it into the following link\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=**\"‍Later that, I tried keybase's file management system (KPFS), it also has \"public\" folder and the links are much more simpler:https://eeril.keybase.pub/*image-name-that-I-choose*‍So new flow looks likeSnip an image using \"Windows + shift+ S\"Click Windows 10 notification (appears right after snipping)Save it to keybase public folderName the image easly while savingjust use eeril.keybase.pub/*fileName*.png as a linkPaste the link to our wiki in Markdown to display it.nootropics:, May 13, 2020 2:07 AM"

I've also realized I made the headband too tight this time, especially on the ears.The first half, I had problems focusing, my mind was like \"you don't have time for this, you have a lot to do\". But I kept reminding myself that whatever I do after meditation goes more smooth. Also my lower spine started to hurt so I lied down and took a more comfortable position. The second half was a \"good\" meditation session imo.I'm not sure whether I can / should / want to take notes of my subjective experiences during \"good meditation\" states. I'll probably do that in future sessions.nootropics:, May 12, 2020 3:05 AM"
