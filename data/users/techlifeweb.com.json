Also known as <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/POSSE\">POSSE</a>.  For example, I can create a post here and with some hidden microformats and the magic of webmentions I my content would be cross-posted or \"syndicated\" over to Twitter or Mastodon or wherever I tell it to go.</p>\n<p>Similarly, I can do the reverse. Knowns as <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/PESOS\">PESOS</a> for Post Elsewhere then Syndicate on your Own Site.  For example, I could make a tweet on Twitter then grab the link to that tweet and save it on this site as a link back to that Tweet.</p>\n<p>You can easily use social sites without all this but the point here is owning your own content. </p>\n<p>Let's take a deeper look at how PESOS would work. I make a Tweet like this one:\n<a class=\"tc-tiddlylink-external\" href=\"https://twitter.com/TechLifeWeb/status/1590424894017540097\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://twitter.com/TechLifeWeb/status/1590424894017540097</a></p>\n<p>Now I want to make a new post here on this site and tell the post that I syndicated it over to Twitter at that URL. The basic framework for that is to make a new post here and include:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;a class=\"syn-link u-syndication relsyn\" rel=\"syndication\" href=\"https://twitter.com/TechLifeWeb/status/1590424894017540097\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>That doesn't look like much if you render it on a web page. No text would be visible. I like to take it a step further and add the text of that Tweet so that it makes more sense if you saw the post on my site here.

            "value": "Websites built adhering to the specifications of the Indieweb allow you to easily post on your own site and syndicate that content elsewhere. Also known as POSSE.  For example, I can create a post here and with some hidden microformats and the magic of webmentions I my content would be cross-posted or \"syndicated\" over to Twitter or Mastodon or wherever I tell it to go.Similarly, I can do the reverse. Knowns as PESOS for Post Elsewhere then Syndicate on your Own Site.  For example, I could make a tweet on Twitter then grab the link to that tweet and save it on this site as a link back to that Tweet.You can easily use social sites without all this but the point here is owning your own content.
