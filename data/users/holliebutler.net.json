          "So this Hugo online notebook idea (I describe the idea here) is proving to be a challenge. I‚Äôve read a few pages about index.md vs. _index.md, and as someone who has never coded or worked with computers past being a user of apps, it all feels like a foreign language. I can‚Äôt deciper what this page means, or this one. This person seems confused too but he must have a background in coding because he read the previous stuff and that clarified things for him.\nMy theme doesn‚Äôt seem to render the pages properly (I‚Äôm using Digital Garden). I don‚Äôt know enough about this to tell whether it‚Äôs the theme that‚Äôs the issue, or just the way I‚Äôve structured things, but basically the problem is that I create a folder and I want the base index page to exist (I know enough HTML to know that index.html is the default page in a folder that the browser loads), but apparently sometimes with Hugo you use _index.md? But I can‚Äôt tell when. The instructions seem to say, ‚ÄúIf folders come after (are nested inside) this one, use _index.md for the uppermost folder,‚Äù but I have tested this and it doesn‚Äôt work. Sometimes the page loads a blank page, sometimes ‚ÄúPage Not Found,‚Äù but never the actual page that has the content on it.\nNext steps:\n\nDefinitely finish the YouTube series from Mike Dane I was watching out on how to get started with Hugo.\nMaybe figuring out what this whole TOML thing is, and how to use it, would help?\nKeep working to finish the HTML and CSS course that I started awhile ago (chronic illness makes progress slow). I feel like this could help a lot in understanding layout, but it still feels like there are many concepts integral to computing in general, that I don‚Äôt recognize or understand. When I watch YouTube tutorials, it‚Äôs clear there are foundational ideas that people assume you must know, that I don‚Äôt recognize."

        ],
        "summary": [
          "My tale of starting Micro.blog, swapping over to ClassicPress, and ending back up on Micro.blog again\nEarly this year when I discovered IndieWeb, I thought it‚Äôd be fun to get back into blogging. Originally I assumed I‚Äôd use WordPress for this. I used WordPress in the early ‚Äò10‚Äôs when my kids were little, and I enjoyed it a lot. I made a handful of different cooking and craft blogs that petered out over time. When Gutenberg came along, I was not a fan (my thoughts echo this person‚Äôs), and I eventually moved more to using Facebook and off blogging entirely.\nSo I was excited to find out there is this magical marvelous thing called ClassicPress, a fork of pre-Gutenberg WordPress, now being lovingly tended by a community of people who wanted to keep that functionality alive. I love community-run projects like this.\nMicro.blog vs. ClassicPress\nMeanwhile, I had also gotten an early account on Micro.blog, without knowing much about it other than I loved the simple aesthetics. Now I was trying to read up on Micro.blog, learning what a static site generator was and what made it different from WordPress. I know a little HTML and CSS, but I don‚Äôt know anything about My SQL or PHP, sysadmin tasks, or any of the underlying parts of either site. But my smattering of HTML and CSS made Micro.blog seem like the better choice, because I would know how to begin modifying themes and tinkering. Tinkering in WordPress code had always been a disaster.\nInitially, Micro.blog was hard for me beacause I couldn‚Äôt have comments from outside Micro.blog. I understand there is a thing called Brid.gy but I don‚Äôt fully understand how it works, and no one I know who isn‚Äôt in a tech field or has tech as one of their major hobbies (this describes 75% of my circle of friends), knows what web mentions are or how to use them.\nThis means that if I meet some nice people in, say, an online sewing group, and I give them a link to the latest skirt I just made, they will have no way to comment on the post I made. If the point of having a blog is to connect with people, then a blog that lacks the functionality for comments seems to discourage that.\nBut then ClassicPress turns out to be unsustainable\nThis past week (October, 2022) I was able to get my own installation of ClassicPress up and going. This felt great, I had some initial trouble but a wonderful person in the ClassicPress community hung out with me for about half an hour one night and helped me figure out how to get the database installed. Again - community is so important, in EVERYTHING, and I can‚Äôt say enough good things about the community support I‚Äôve received and seen in all three of these places I‚Äôve been exploring, IndieWeb, ClassicPress, and Micro.blog.\nI installed some IndieWeb plug-ins that I barely understood, but after a page I made about my chronic illness received some nice comments on Twitter, those comments did show up on my ClassicPress blog, which was pretty cool. Woot!\nBut then‚Ä¶\nHowever the problem with ClassicPress is that apparently most web hosts see it as an outdated version of WordPress. As it was explained to me, this makes sense from a security standpoint. Outdated apps offer up vulnerabilities that, when exploited, might affect more on the server than your site alone.\nThere are apparently a few web hosts who have an installer called Softaculous, which will install and maintain ClassicPress properly, eliminating these concerns, but from what I understand, these web hosts are hard to find. My web host is SiteGround, and they don‚Äôt have a Softaculous installer, and instead have an unfortunate history of auto-updating ClassicPress installations with the current version of WordPress, as happened to this guy a few months ago.\nI read this thread but was encouraged by the fact that apparently he contacted SiteGround support, and got them to remove his site from auto-updates? That seemed easy enough. So after futzing around with my own ClassicPress installation at holliebutler.net and getting everything just the way I liked it, I contacted SiteGround.\nBut I got a totally different story. I wrote about that exchange in the ClassicPress forums, but the gist of it is, they won‚Äôt remove my site from auto-updates:\nWe strongly discourage hosting outdated installations for extended periods of time, which is why the Autoupdate tool allows for a WP version update to be skipped, but does not allow for the installation to be completely excluded from the autoupdate system.\nThis seems to go against that the other guy was told, but there didn‚Äôt seem to be anything I could do. This means my only option was to keep track of any WordPress version updates on my own, and then go into my settings buried in my SiteGround account, and turn off each individual update as it approached. This just isn‚Äôt sustainable. I‚Äôm coping with a chronic illness, my brain is often a bit fogged and I‚Äôm routinely out of energy to deal with mundane details like this; there‚Äôs no way I will remember to do this.\nAnd as it turns out, I had already missed one! In my SiteGround settings, when I went to see how to turn off the updates, it had already updated my site to WordPress 6.0.1. BAH.\nBack to Micro.blog I go\nI was so frustrated when I saw this, at midnight last night, that I went to my domain host (here I will make a plug for Porkbun.com, I just moved my domains here and I‚Äôm loving them - great tech support!) and moved my domain to point to my Micro.blog. I moved over the couple pages that I‚Äôd made so those links would still work. Once it was moved, I felt relief. I don‚Äôt have to stress about Micro.blog. I can add posts, I can tinker when I want or leave it alone for months, and it‚Äôs going to keep working whether I‚Äôm staring at it or not. The community around here is vibrant and the crew in charge is always thinking up new ways to make it better.\nThe only downside to Micro.blog, for me personally, is that lack of comments from outside the system. I was able to set up Reply by Email, a great plug-in by @sod, and I‚Äôm hoping that will get some use.\nBut my perspective on comments has changed a bit through all this. I remember when we were all blogging fifteen years ago, I knew dozens of folks at the time with WordPress blogs similar to mine, and it was true that we had a great time posting comments to each other. But spam - and occasionally harassing comments - was also a problem that had to be dealt with, and that took time I didn‚Äôt enjoy giving up. These days, with fewer blogs and fewer people commenting to them, it doesn‚Äôt feel as urgent to have that functionality. In my sewing group example, it‚Äôs likely that someone would comment on my link within the group rather than at the blog, anyway. So overall I‚Äôve become less concerned about whether a lack of comments will necessarily mean a lack of connection.\nOther upsides include:\n\nMuch less expensive than SiteGround ($10/month for my Premium plan at Micro.blog vs. $25/month at SiteGround)\nEasy to use MarsEdit for publishing (I could never get MarsEdit to work with my WordPress installations)\nWith the Premium account, friends and family can subscribe to my newsletter (once I‚Äôd lost JetPack I couldn‚Äôt find a way to enable that functionality with ClassicPress)\nThe option of podcasting if I ever want to play with that idea (part of the Premium account)\nTinkerable code\n\nSo here I am!\nI‚Äôm hoping I can get some friends interested in blogging and getting their own Micro.blog accounts. :)"
