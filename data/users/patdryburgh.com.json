              "The steel drum band that played as attendees entered the auditorium was awesome. Great vibe.\n  I don’t understand why it was held indoors instead of a park with ample shade. Also… steel drums were made to be played outdoors.\n  There appeared to be very few chairs available for those who needed them. Maybe they were available and I didn’t notice them, but I wasn’t not looking.\n  The mic volume for the speakers was way too quiet and at times was difficult to hear.\n  Meanwhile, recorded music that played as speakers entered the stage was so loud, a few attendees had to leave the auditorium.\n  There were a few hundred people in attendance (I’d guess 300 and I once won a teddy bear by guessing the number of jelly beans in a jar). I have no idea how many people were in attendance. Please see correction note below 🤦‍♂️\n  The audience filled approximately 5/8 of the available space. When I decided to attend, I expected there to be thousands of attendees, but they would not have fit.\n  I saw no police and couldn’t identify any security.\n  Approximately 4/5 of attendees were very engaged and enthusiastic. The remaining were more reserved—like myself—plus a few dozen wandering teenagers.\n  Lots of people brought signs and signs were provided. There was a large surplus of signs. Here’s hoping the signs get reused. That should be a law. Also… hemp signs only #makemeyourruler\n  Almost no one was social distanced. In fact, orange-masked volunteers were encouraging us to move closer to the stage and therefore each other. I refused and made my way to the back of the auditorium in a spot where the radius between myself and all others was at its greatest, made complicated by the teenage wanderers.\n  Everyone wore masks inside, but there were many, many exposed noses. I would have spoken up but am afraid of teenagers.\n  I was glad to have an N95 mask because those other masks are dogshit. Go ahead. Put one on, light a match, and see how easy it can be blown out. Of course, having a beard reduces the effectiveness of any mask as does prolonged exposure in a crowded indoor space… 🤦‍♂️ Science is hard; don’t message me.\n  I resonated with the message that was presented, though I recognize all political parties are complicated and speak to different segments of our population in different ways, some more dangerous than others. I don’t think any political party is perfect, but through my experience with my parents and the values they instilled in me, I am strongly convicted that health care is both a human right and a significant asset for Canadian society and that we need to do more, not less, to expand accessibility and include other services like dental and mental health.\n\n\nPolitics is only one of many methods by which we interact with our fellow humans.\n\nMay it never be the most important.\n\n—\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this post estimated attendance of Saturday’s rally to be around 300 people. Admittedly, this was intended to be a conservative estimate. Upon reviewing video taken during the event and learning the max capacity of the Canadian Convention Centre is 1,600, the author now believes attendance of the rally to be closer to 1,000 as claimed by Ontario NDP. The author realizes now that winning a teddy bear by guessing the number of jelly beans in a jar was a case of good luck and not a skill transferable to estimating crowd sizes. The author regrets the error.\n\nIn fact, now I feel incredibly stupid and owe a sincere apology to the Ontario NDP. What I had intended to be a conservative estimate of 300–400 was in fact less than half of what I now believe the attendance to have been.\n\nI apologize to the Ontario NDP, the volunteers who organized and produced the event, and to anyone who read my initial estimate and believed it to be true. I realize lies travel faster than the truth and I am sorry I contributed a falsehood to the story of this event.\n\n\n      \n\n      \n      \n        \n\n        \n          ※ Permalink for “Thoughts on my first political rally” published on date_to_rfc822"

I would have spoken up but am afraid of teenagers.\n  I was glad to have an N95 mask because those other masks are dogshit. Go ahead. Put one on, light a match, and see how easy it can be blown out. Of course, having a beard reduces the effectiveness of any mask as does prolonged exposure in a crowded indoor space… 🤦‍♂️ Science is hard; don’t message me.\n  I resonated with the message that was presented, though I recognize all political parties are complicated and speak to different segments of our population in different ways, some more dangerous than others. I don’t think any political party is perfect, but through my experience with my parents and the values they instilled in me, I am strongly convicted that health care is both a human right and a significant asset for Canadian society and that we need to do more, not less, to expand accessibility and include other services like dental and mental health.\n\n\nPolitics is only one of many methods by which we interact with our fellow humans.\n\nMay it never be the most important.\n\n—\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this post estimated attendance of Saturday’s rally to be around 300 people. Admittedly, this was intended to be a conservative estimate. Upon reviewing video taken during the event and learning the max capacity of the Canadian Convention Centre is 1,600, the author now believes attendance of the rally to be closer to 1,000 as claimed by Ontario NDP. The author realizes now that winning a teddy bear by guessing the number of jelly beans in a jar was a case of good luck and not a skill transferable to estimating crowd sizes. The author regrets the error.\n\nIn fact, now I feel incredibly stupid and owe a sincere apology to the Ontario NDP. What I had intended to be a conservative estimate of 300–400 was in fact less than half of what I now believe the attendance to have been.\n\nI apologize to the Ontario NDP, the volunteers who organized and produced the event, and to anyone who read my initial estimate and believed it to be true. I realize lies travel faster than the truth and I am sorry I contributed a falsehood to the story of this event.\n\n\n      \n\n      \n      \n        \n\n        \n          ※ Permalink for “Thoughts on my first political rally” published on date_to_rfc822"
