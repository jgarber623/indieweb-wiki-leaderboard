A more generous reader might label it avant-garde; the Guardian blurb on the front says \"surreal\", but personally I'd go with pretentious and unfunny.</p>\n<p>I'm a fan of Ayoade, and not just for being the best thing about The IT Crowd and a pedantic participant in Big Fat Quiz; I've followed him since Garth Marenghi, enjoyed his roles in The Mighty Boosh and Nathan Barley, and watched and enjoyed Submarine and The Double. I even own a copy of AD/BC, the Matt Berry rock opera for which Ayoade wrote the lyrics. In interviews and panel shows I've always found his humour clever and intellectual ... which is why this book is such a massive disappointment.

A more generous reader might label it avant-garde; the Guardian blurb on the front says \"surreal\", but personally I'd go with pretentious and unfunny.\nI'm a fan of Ayoade, and not just for being the best thing about The IT Crowd and a pedantic participant in Big Fat Quiz; I've followed him since Garth Marenghi, enjoyed his roles in The Mighty Boosh and Nathan Barley, and watched and enjoyed Submarine and The Double.
