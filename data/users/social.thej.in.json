If you dont know the answer say it out loud \"I dont Know\"2. Append \"But, I will find out\".3. Dont just say it, mean it and go for the hunt. Find answer to that question. dig deep but do find that answer so next time someone ask's that question you dont have to say \"I dont Know\"Ways to acquire such answers:1. Ask your peers.2. ask your seniors / mentors / known people.3. Ask in public4. Research yourself.5. Experiment yourselfMove away from the point of \"I dont know\" reach somewhere else.Not knowing something is fine, not being able to understand something is also fine. what is not fine for me is that you are aware that you dont know but you are still not making effort to know about it. If at the end you dont fully understand it then also its fine but now you dont have a \"I dont know\" state, you have a \"I dont fully understand it\" state.#knowledge #acceptingIgnorance"
