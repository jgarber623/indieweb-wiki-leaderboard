Hilarious game show focusing on the previous week's news.\r\n\r\n\r\n“I Like These Too” Podcasts\r\nI'll listen to these if I've already caught up on my top-tier podcasts.\r\n\r\nMicromobility: Exploration of the \"light individual transport\" space from a business disruption perspective.\r\nMilk Street Radio: A food, recipes, and cooking show.\r\nThe Splendid Table: Another food, recipes, and cooking show.\r\nThis American Life: This used to be a top-tier show, but now I have to decide if I'm in an emotional state to handle potentially heartbreaking stories. Each episode has a theme and then 3 or 4 stories around that theme.\r\n\r\n\r\n“I'm Subscribed, but I Don't Really Listen” Podcasts\r\n\r\nDirty South Soccer: An SB Nation Atlanta United podcast.\r\nThe Falcoholic: An SB Nation Falcons podcast.\r\nSouthern Fried Soccer: An AJC Atlanta United podcast."
