So far, mostly so good. My adventure started off on April 1 (no joke) with a bus ride from Hartford and then a shuttle to and flight from Boston Logan. Boston has done a good job getting people from the bus terminal to South Station, so props to them for that. No real trouble at Logan, except the flight was delayed 20 minutes. I even got an aisle seat in a nine seat row, so that was very nice since the Crohn’s was acting up a bit.</p>\n<p>Passport control wasn’t bad at all, though getting though it took about an hour. Had some slight trouble at Gatwick Station accessing my ticket. I guess with my ticket, it is mobile only and I hadn’t downloaded it to my phone! Finally asked someone about the issue but their Internet was a bit shoddy. Eventually got my ticket and was off.</p>\n<p>No such issues with the Underground to my hostel. It was very easy to get a ticket. Like with all subways, it takes a moment to learn it, but it was not too bad to figure out. After six hours in London, got to the hostel and settled in a bit.</p>\n<p>I then took off to see some sights, starting with Trafalgar Square. Lots of people milling around there and going to the National Gallery.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://dymersion.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/wp-image-462360174jpg.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://dymersion.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/wp-image-462360174jpg.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1153 alignnone size-full\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\"></a></p>\n<p>I spent a little time there and then headed down to the Palace of Westminster and Big Ben.

I’ll be getting back to the continent after 10 years away, the last trip there being to Greece in 2007. It’s going to be a bit of a whirlwind of a trip. Why? Because I’m my own worst enemy. What started out as a desire to travel to London and then east to Belgium and The Netherlands has since turned into a bit a monster of a trip that will see me travel in all four cardinal directions. I’ll again be going on a massive train ride that will take me to seven countries in this time period.</p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1146\" src=\"https://dymersion.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/europe-map-itinerary.png\" alt=\"Europe Trip 2017 Train Route Map\" width=\"891\" height=\"879\" srcset=\"https://dymersion.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/europe-map-itinerary.png 891w, https://dymersion.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/europe-map-itinerary-300x296.png 300w, https://dymersion.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/europe-map-itinerary-768x758.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 891px) 100vw, 891px\"></p>\n<p>The above map shows more or less the route I’ll be taking through Europe. Starting out in London for a couple days, I’ll continue on Eurostar to Ghent, Begium for a day, and then the intercity train to Amsterdam for a couple days.  I’ll continue into Germany, stopping in Cologne and Bonn for a couple days. Then I’ll have what I think will be the first big highlight of this trip with a ride along the Rhine River on my way to the little southern German city of Freiburg.

                "value": "I haven’t written much about this trip, here or on Facebook. In fact, I haven’t written about a trip here since the big Cross-Country train trip in 2015, even though I’ve been to San Diego (on business) and to Orlando and Canada (Niagara Falls, Toronto, and Montreal – for pleasure) since.\nI’m heading to Europe for 16 days in just under a week from now. I’ll be getting back to the continent after 10 years away, the last trip there being to Greece in 2007. It’s going to be a bit of a whirlwind of a trip. Why? Because I’m my own worst enemy. What started out as a desire to travel to London and then east to Belgium and The Netherlands has since turned into a bit a monster of a trip that will see me travel in all four cardinal directions. I’ll again be going on a massive train ride that will take me to seven countries in this time period.\n Europe Trip 2017 Train Route Map \nThe above map shows more or less the route I’ll be taking through Europe.
