            "value": "Castle in Gent \nAlthough my primary goal of this trip is riding the trains, one of the disadvantages of spending only a small amount of time in any given place is that when something happens, you now have even less time to explore that place than you did before.\nSuch was the case with this leg of the trip. It actually started on the second night in London when suddenly I was experiencing a nausea-like feeling from my stomach. I’m still not sure what it was – maybe a stomach acid thing – but fearing a stomach bug, it sent me back to my room rather than seek out food that night.\nI would note that I was still transitioning to the time difference, travel fatigue and all, as well as having kind of pushed myself the first day to stay up, so that may have been part of it.\nRegardless of the cause, I was able to get up and to the station for my Eurostar trip to Brussels.\nThinking that maybe the issue was lack of food, I grabbed some breakfast after passport control in St. Pancras. The train trip itself was indeed fast and uneventful. We passed through the Channel and into France and then Belgium.\nUpon getting to Brussels, it was clear this stomach issue wasn’t going away.

They’ll say something about him and he’ll hop on Twitter to fire off one or more tweets in anger about those he feels have slighted him.\n\nWacky @NYTimesDowd, who hardly knows me, makes up things that I never said for her boring interviews and column. A neurotic dope!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 17, 2016\n\n\nCrazy Maureen Dowd, the wacky columnist for the failing @nytimes, pretends she knows me well–wrong!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 17, 2016\n\n\nThe failing @nytimes has gone nuts that Crooked Hillary is doing so badly. They are willing to say anything, has become a laughingstock rag!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 17, 2016\n\nI think many people will brush off criticisms about these Twitter, thinking something like “They’re just journalists. They definitely deserve it for lying about him.”\nLying or not, they’re not just journalists. Yesterday he also went on one of his rants against Robert Gates, the former Secretary of Defense. Weirdly his defense for doing this is that Gates spoke out against his former bosses. Well, his last boss in government was Obama, so you’d think that would be okay with Trump, but I guess not.\n\nNever met but never liked dopey Robert Gates. Look at the mess the U.S. is in. Always speaks badly of his many bosses, including Obama.\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 17, 2016\n\nOnce again we’re seeing how Trump immensely dislikes disloyalty to him personally and will trash anyone who goes against him, even in a small way. That is extremely disturbing as the president’s job is to represent the entire nation, not just his personal ego.\nBut Gates was a political appointee, so maybe some think that opens him up to criticism like this. Okay, perhaps, but who is Trump going to go after next? Well, we know that despite his statements to the contrary, he’s perfectly fine going after first responders as he once trashed a fire marshal just hours after being rescued from an elevator by the marshal’s fellow firefighters. This person said nothing about Trump and yet it still happened anyway.\nWorse still, Trump doesn’t just go after people, he usually assigns them some kind of epithet. Just in the last 24 hours, he’s used “wacky,” “crazy,” and “dopey” on two different people. In the past, he’s been well known for using “bimbo” against people like Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly. “Lying” and “crooked” are also favorites of his, though they’re not quite as bad, and are pretty typical for a political campaign. The others, though, are just attempts to discredit the dissenter as someone to who people shouldn’t listen. Maybe that’s okay to do as a private citizen, but never okay to do as president.\nWho is Trump going to go after next? Will a President Trump go after a general who disagrees with him, even privately, or doesn’t quite get the job done? Maybe a rank-and-file member of the military? A member of a police force? A foreign diplomat or head of state or government. The point is that we really don’t know, but do we really want to give someone the presidency who so frequently goes on tantrums against people he doesn’t like?\nThat’s what we as a nation have to decide this November."

Got some necessities at a nearby Walgreens and took a walk of the immediate area, selected a nearby Italian place for dinner, then went to bed.</p>\n<p>Got a late start the next day due to wanting more sleep. I think people oftentimes want to get a full day of activities, but I think a late day here or there during a trip is okay. I’m having a very early day on Sunday, so it’ll balance out.</p>\n<p>I decided to start with Fisherman’s Wharf. Before the trip, I purchased a CityPass, which got me access to several museums, a cruise in San Francisco Bay, and most importantly, unlimited travel on the Muni system of electric and diesel buses, light rail, historic street cars, and cable car trolleys. Basically, no more taxis (except, as of this writing, maybe on Sunday morning.</p>\n<p>I took the cruise and it was a pretty good way to get an up close look at the Golden Gate Bridge, and some history of the city. Very cold and windy, though! In fact, that was my first lesson when arriving in the city. I knew it would be cooler than Los Angeles or even Chicago (making my clothing choices, if you didn’t know my plans, look like I couldn’t decide what to bring), and even windy, but I wasnt prepared for the intensity of the wind. I brought my coat and jeans, so I was prepared, but I tried to go out the first night without it. Rookie mistake.</p>\n<p>I next went to the Aquarium at the Bay (my other option was the Monterey Aquarium, two hours away). It had a lot of cool fish and I got to touch a ray! I think they knew the game of which they were a part, as they kept coming right up to people. I thought the aquarium was okay for what it was. True to its name, it featured animals mostly from the Bay Area.</p>\n<p>I walked around Pier 39 some more, had some lunch, and then decided to leave. I decided to board one of the hisoric streetcars. It was pretty much like one of the regular buses but from the 1950s. I up ended up in the Embarcadero area, thinking to o<br>\nravel to the Transbay Hub, but I felt a little lost still, so turned back. I ended up grabbing a cable car trolley (no, I didn’t hang off the side). Without the city pass, it would have cost $7.00, but with the pass, it’s like having another bus option. </p>\n<p>I got off on a street that had the bus I needed to take and found myself in Chinatown. When I salked to the bus stop, there was some kind of performance going on across the street. I later found out it was in front of the Kong Chow Temple, dedicated to the god of war, Guan Di. It was after closing time, so I’m not sure of the occasion. A private event, perhaps. Boarded the bus when it arrived and headed back to the hotel.</p>\n<p>I either ate too many of my snacks, or maybe it was from my hotdog lunch, but I did not have a great night Wednesday night. Feeling kind of woozy, I just stayed in my room on Thursday and got some rest.</p>\n<p>I felt better on Friday morning, so I went to Home Plate, a popular brunch restaurant near my hotel. There wasn’t much seating, so I thought there’d be lengthy wait, but being a solo traveler has its advantages, and I got a seat at the bar-like area quickly. I had a breakfast of pancakes, bacon, and apple juice. It was pretty good. There were only two pancakes, and I thought maybe there wouldn’t be enough to fill me up, but it did. The restaurant is also known for its scones, which it gives before the main meal. Not really having scones before, I thought it was okay.</p>\n<p>After breakfast, I returned to my room to wait for my pickup en route to the redwoods at Muir Woods. The trip took about 40 minutes, with switchbacks that reminded me a lot of ones I experienced during a bus trip in Greece. The park was pretty nice, with trees that were younger than some of the redwoods upstate, but still really tall. Spent about an hour and a half there – way too little time to get very far – so definitely will have to go back someday. Returned to the hotel, got some food, and called it a day.</p>\n<p>On Saturday, I traveled to Golden Gate Park to see the California Academy of Sciences and the de Young Museum, an art museum.

Sometimes with older artists, you wonder if they’ll attract a younger audience, and he definitely does. Everyone was singing along and I could tell they enjoyed it, too.

Boarded the bus when it arrived and headed back to the hotel.\nI either ate too many of my snacks, or maybe it was from my hotdog lunch, but I did not have a great night Wednesday night. Feeling kind of woozy, I just stayed in my room on Thursday and got some rest.\nI felt better on Friday morning, so I went to Home Plate, a popular brunch restaurant near my hotel. There wasn’t much seating, so I thought there’d be lengthy wait, but being a solo traveler has its advantages, and I got a seat at the bar-like area quickly. I had a breakfast of pancakes, bacon, and apple juice. It was pretty good. There were only two pancakes, and I thought maybe there wouldn’t be enough to fill me up, but it did. The restaurant is also known for its scones, which it gives before the main meal. Not really having scones before, I thought it was okay.\nAfter breakfast, I returned to my room to wait for my pickup en route to the redwoods at Muir Woods. The trip took about 40 minutes, with switchbacks that reminded me a lot of ones I experienced during a bus trip in Greece. The park was pretty nice, with trees that were younger than some of the redwoods upstate, but still really tall. Spent about an hour and a half there – way too little time to get very far – so definitely will have to go back someday. Returned to the hotel, got some food, and called it a day.\nOn Saturday, I traveled to Golden Gate Park to see the California Academy of Sciences and the de Young Museum, an art museum. Also didnt have enough time to see either, nor did I see the Legion of Honor, another art museum. I had to get across town to get my ticket back to Emeryville, then to AT&T Park to see Billy Joel.\nHe did a fantastic show – a mix of hits and catalouge songs. He definitely still has a lot of the range he used to. Some artists sound terrible when they get older, but not him. The audience was also very cross-generational. There were people 18+ at least. Sometimes with older artists, you wonder if they’ll attract a younger audience, and he definitely does. Everyone was singing along and I could tell they enjoyed it, too. The park was in a great location right next to the east bay. Just a great night.\nThat’s it, really. Will have to get back to see the many things I missed, but despite being sick, I still had a really great time. \nNext, a day in LA, then a train to Chicago!"
