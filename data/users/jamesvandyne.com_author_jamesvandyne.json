( I just checked their site and they have some that you can screw into the ground....seems very convenient,  but I'm not bringing my drill-gun – feels like cheating.)The other lesson was that, when building the dome of our tents that you're not going to break it when bending the dome to get the roof in place. I think we maybe bought too much tent (a 2-dome tent), but I reckon we're going to always want to some kind of shade to hang out in when we're not sleeping, so it saves us from building 2 different things.The mountains and river were beautiful. Definitely looking forward to a second trip, maybe in spring.A year after starting our initial quote requests and 7 months after signing a contract, we finally got our solar and battery installed! As of this writing it's still not 100% finished – everything is installed, but I think there's still a bit of work to do around the breakers.When we discussed the layout of the panels, they'd said that the panels would come to the very edge of the roof – and they weren't lying. This is only possible because Sharp makes non-rectangular panels. I'll make a separate post my panels when they're all hooked up and running.\n\n https://jamesvandyne.com/files/a4e7d90e-d67d-43c3-a872-b76f8a7ed38c \nPanels right to the edge of the roof"
