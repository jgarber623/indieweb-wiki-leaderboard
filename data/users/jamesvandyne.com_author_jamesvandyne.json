            "html": "<ul>\n<li>It's the start of a new year and I've had quite more free time than usual, which meant I enjoyed making heaps of progress on various bits of Tanzawa. I merged initial support for owning my own activity / exercise data via an integration with Strava. I made sure to write it in a vendor agnostic manner, so should I need to switch to a different provider, or someone else wants to use a different app, having them co-exist will be quite simple.</li>\n<li>I'm really proud of the<a href=\"https://jamesvandyne.com/runs/\"> public runs page</a> I've managed to design thus far. There's still room for improvement, but I'm really happy with the gallery of paths. Fun fact, the open graph/meta image that's displayed when you link to it changes each time I go for a run. If you haven't yet, give it a scroll.</li>\n<li>Back to the new year – we did the usual, soba noodles at the in-laws on NYE and a visit to the shrine day-of with a traditional Japanese breakfast. Leo has started eating udon noodles recently, so he had udon instead of soba. This style of new years has it's charms, but it would also be nice to go out or travel somewhere, too. Maybe someplace warm.</li>\n<li>Before NYE, we did spend the night in downtown Yokohama and it was a lot of fun. Leo ice skated for the first time and really enjoyed it. By the time we finished, he was just getting the hang of it. Compared to the last time we had breakfast he did fantastic at the buffet this time around. He walked with me, picked out bacon, ham, eggs, bread, potatoes - and ate it all.<br><br>As promising as the morning started, like most trips we take, he doesn't quite understand (or want to accept) that we can't go back and do the same thing again the <em>next day</em>. So he had a public meltdown between the hotel and the station because he didn't want to walk and I didn't want to carry him. There's nothing worse (there is, but roll with me here) than having a crying kid in public when there's all these happy kids and families walking by...you just start asking yourself what did I do wrong?

            "value": "It's the start of a new year and I've had quite more free time than usual, which meant I enjoyed making heaps of progress on various bits of Tanzawa. I merged initial support for owning my own activity / exercise data via an integration with Strava. I made sure to write it in a vendor agnostic manner, so should I need to switch to a different provider, or someone else wants to use a different app, having them co-exist will be quite simple.I'm really proud of the public runs page I've managed to design thus far. There's still room for improvement, but I'm really happy with the gallery of paths. Fun fact, the open graph/meta image that's displayed when you link to it changes each time I go for a run. If you haven't yet, give it a scroll.Back to the new year – we did the usual, soba noodles at the in-laws on NYE and a visit to the shrine day-of with a traditional Japanese breakfast. Leo has started eating udon noodles recently, so he had udon instead of soba. This style of new years has it's charms, but it would also be nice to go out or travel somewhere, too. Maybe someplace warm.Before NYE, we did spend the night in downtown Yokohama and it was a lot of fun. Leo ice skated for the first time and really enjoyed it. By the time we finished, he was just getting the hang of it. Compared to the last time we had breakfast he did fantastic at the buffet this time around. He walked with me, picked out bacon, ham, eggs, bread, potatoes - and ate it all.As promising as the morning started, like most trips we take, he doesn't quite understand (or want to accept) that we can't go back and do the same thing again the next day. So he had a public meltdown between the hotel and the station because he didn't want to walk and I didn't want to carry him. There's nothing worse (there is, but roll with me here) than having a crying kid in public when there's all these happy kids and families walking by...you just start asking yourself what did I do wrong? Why can't my kid walk/smile/run like those kids. The answer is those kids aren't always like that and  my kid isn't always like this, but it really sucks ending what's supposed to be a fun/relaxing trip this way.

But with a burst of inspiration, I completed the Strava integration, which rounded out my main goals:</div>\n<ul>\n<li>1-click-ish deployment (close enough for me with the fly.io deployment instructions)</li>\n<li>Theme support </li>\n<li>Strava plugin</li>\n<li>Bonus, as to support the longevity of the project, a proper refactor.</li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n<br>There's a lot yet I'd like to do in Tanzawa next year:</div>\n<ul>\n<li>More robust Strava plugin. More stats. More maps. More bells and whistles.</li>\n<li>Migrate the remaining bits of Turbo (and maybe Stimulus, if possible?) to HTMX.</li>\n<li>More plugins and settings. I generally like Trix, the WYSIWYG editor I use in Tanzawa. But sometimes I want to write <em>certain</em> posts in Markdown.</li>\n<li>Better syndication UI – so I'm not always manually syndicating things to Mastodon</li>\n<li>Photo/Gallery/Video(?) post support. I've got a blog post in my drafts outlining this from August. I should finish it.</li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n<br><strong>Sunbottle</strong><br>I wasn't expecting to start this project. But after I got solar installed on my roof and I had  to use Sharp's slow/ad-filled(!) \"app\", I had no choice.  I don't have any real big/long-term plans for Sunbottle. I do plan to integrate it with Octopus Energy's API, so I can make a page to to breakdown my costs/savings with my small array.<br><br>I am thankful this project came up though, because it gave me reason to stick to figuring out how to deploy simple Django apps on Fly.io, which unblocked me with getting Tanzawa onto a managed service.<br><br>\n</div>\n<h1>Health</h1>\n<div>Each year people say they're going to start taking more care of themselves this year and then they do good for a month or so before falling back into their old patterns and habits. I am no different.<br><br>Last year I set myself a goal to run 100 times. I missed it by quite a bit – only 57 runs. If I include proper rides, I get up to 69 events. BUT!

            "value": "It's that time of the year for me to reflect on the past year and judge how it went. See previous editions for  2021 and 2020.tl;dr 2022 was a good year for me, generally speaking. Side ProjectsI expanded my side projects from one (Tanzawa) to two (Tanzawa and SunBottle). TanzawaAsk me 2 weeks ago if I was going to finish everything I hoped I would in Tanzawa this year and I would've said \"probably not\". But with a burst of inspiration, I completed the Strava integration, which rounded out my main goals:1-click-ish deployment (close enough for me with the fly.io deployment instructions)Theme support Strava pluginBonus, as to support the longevity of the project, a proper refactor.There's a lot yet I'd like to do in Tanzawa next year:More robust Strava plugin. More stats. More maps. More bells and whistles.Migrate the remaining bits of Turbo (and maybe Stimulus, if possible?) to HTMX.More plugins and settings. I generally like Trix, the WYSIWYG editor I use in Tanzawa. But sometimes I want to write certain posts in Markdown.Better syndication UI – so I'm not always manually syndicating things to MastodonPhoto/Gallery/Video(?) post support. I've got a blog post in my drafts outlining this from August. I should finish it.SunbottleI wasn't expecting to start this project. But after I got solar installed on my roof and I had  to use Sharp's slow/ad-filled(!) \"app\", I had no choice.  I don't have any real big/long-term plans for Sunbottle. I do plan to integrate it with Octopus Energy's API, so I can make a page to to breakdown my costs/savings with my small array.I am thankful this project came up though, because it gave me reason to stick to figuring out how to deploy simple Django apps on Fly.io, which unblocked me with getting Tanzawa onto a managed service.HealthEach year people say they're going to start taking more care of themselves this year and then they do good for a month or so before falling back into their old patterns and habits. I am no different.Last year I set myself a goal to run 100 times. I missed it by quite a bit – only 57 runs. If I include proper rides, I get up to 69 events. BUT! This is the most I've ever run in a year! Here's my totals:2022: 572021: 252020: 122019: 42018: 512017: 162016: 02015: 92014: 192013: 02012: 1If current trends continue, I reckon I should get to 114 - 116 runs next year.
