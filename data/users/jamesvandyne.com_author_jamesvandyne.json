The heavier lift was decoupling the Tanzawa micropub endpoint from the admin views/forms, and then updating the admin views to no longer expect IndieWeb extension data (reply/bookmark url/titles etc...) on update (it's still required on create).Thankfully I had functional tests for my micropub endpoint, so I could be confident that my refactoring didn't break existing functionality. Those tests allowed me to extract the logic from the admin forms and put them into a application function. This new application functions are reused by all interfaces creating/updating entries. The next phase was adding tests to the admin views and then updating them to use the common application functions. This work was mostly a slog because I needed to add tests and better factories for my tests before doing the actual refactor. There's still more improvement that can be made in the test factories to make them a bit more DRY, but they're good enough for now.Working with HTMX has been a dream. Rather than using  Javascript to tweak DOM, I can simply make calls to the backend to get html from the backend by adding just a couple of attributes to my template dom. All of this using the same django templates.My next steps with HTMX are going to be to look into integrating django-components, so I can wrap up the Javascript I do need with the their templates/css and do some more refactoring. For example, right now reply/bookmarks have effectively the same templates / views duplicated. Using components, I should be able to have a single logical component to power both.If the components strategy works, I will look at breaking out various parts of Tanzawa into htmx/django-components for easier maintenance e.g. the location selector or location view on the bottom of checkins."
