                "html": "<p>It happened. For a long time I had heard about hiking up Mt. Whitney. The highest peak in the lower 48. 14,505 ft. 4421m. I knew you had to get a permit and I knew you had to prepare. Every year I would think about it and then forget about it and then it was too late until the next year. Late in 2021 I thought about it. Then asked a good friend who is comfortable with mountains if he wanted to go. There was no hesitation.</p>\n<p>We made a plan to attack the permit process. We failed to get a permit in the initial lottery and then again when the unrequested dates opened up. There was one last chance to acquire a permit when the unclaimed permits were put back into the system. This time, success! But later in the year than we had hoped. October 18th was getting a little late and there was a good chance weather could spoil the trip.</p>\n<p>Our hope was to get an overnight permit so we could hike up the trail a bit, camp, then summit the next morning. The permit we obtained was day use only. The plan was to be on the trail by 3am. Summit before noon then back down before dark. There was, however, a slim chance we could get an overnight permit. Each day at 11am any unused permits enter back into the system and can be claimed. We packed for both scenarios.</p>\n<p>Arrival. The original plan was to camp at the Whitney Portal Campground (~8000′) on Sunday and Monday nights. This would give us a little altitude acclimation, time to do a little warm up hike, and some time to rest before the big walk. Monday morning we made a hearty breakfast and then drove down the hill a bit to find internet and check the permit site. Low and behold, 15 overnight permits were available! Now, we had prepared mentally and physically to do the whole thing in a day with a light pack and now had to rearrange expectations and assure ourselves that hiking to Trail Camp (12,000′) with all of our gear was going to be fine. We drove back to our portal camp and quickly rearranged and repacked. We were starting now.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2247 size-large\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://social.vaughnhannon.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/v-trailhead-1024x768.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"675\" srcset=\"https://social.vaughnhannon.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/v-trailhead-1024x768.png 1024w, https://social.vaughnhannon.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/v-trailhead-300x225.png 300w, https://social.vaughnhannon.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/v-trailhead-768x576.png 768w, https://social.vaughnhannon.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/v-trailhead-1536x1152.png 1536w, https://social.vaughnhannon.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/v-trailhead-2048x1536.png 2048w, https://social.vaughnhannon.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/v-trailhead-900x675.png 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\"> <img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2248 size-large\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://social.vaughnhannon.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/m_trailhead-1024x771.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"678\" srcset=\"https://social.vaughnhannon.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/m_trailhead-1024x771.jpg 1024w, https://social.vaughnhannon.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/m_trailhead-300x226.jpg 300w, https://social.vaughnhannon.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/m_trailhead-768x578.jpg 768w, https://social.vaughnhannon.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/m_trailhead-1536x1157.jpg 1536w, https://social.vaughnhannon.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/m_trailhead-2048x1542.jpg 2048w, https://social.vaughnhannon.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/m_trailhead-900x678.jpg 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\"></p>\n<p><iframe class=\"alltrails\" title=\"AllTrails: Trail Guides and Maps for Hiking, Camping, and Running\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.alltrails.com/widget/recording/mount-whitney-trail-818cdcf--4?u=i\" width=\"100%\" height=\"400\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><br>\nWe hiked the 7 miles in and 4000′ up to Trail Camp.

                "value": "It happened. For a long time I had heard about hiking up Mt. Whitney. The highest peak in the lower 48. 14,505 ft. 4421m. I knew you had to get a permit and I knew you had to prepare. Every year I would think about it and then forget about it and then it was too late until the next year. Late in 2021 I thought about it. Then asked a good friend who is comfortable with mountains if he wanted to go. There was no hesitation.\nWe made a plan to attack the permit process. We failed to get a permit in the initial lottery and then again when the unrequested dates opened up. There was one last chance to acquire a permit when the unclaimed permits were put back into the system. This time, success! But later in the year than we had hoped. October 18th was getting a little late and there was a good chance weather could spoil the trip.\nOur hope was to get an overnight permit so we could hike up the trail a bit, camp, then summit the next morning. The permit we obtained was day use only. The plan was to be on the trail by 3am. Summit before noon then back down before dark. There was, however, a slim chance we could get an overnight permit. Each day at 11am any unused permits enter back into the system and can be claimed. We packed for both scenarios.\nArrival. The original plan was to camp at the Whitney Portal Campground (~8000′) on Sunday and Monday nights. This would give us a little altitude acclimation, time to do a little warm up hike, and some time to rest before the big walk. Monday morning we made a hearty breakfast and then drove down the hill a bit to find internet and check the permit site. Low and behold, 15 overnight permits were available! Now, we had prepared mentally and physically to do the whole thing in a day with a light pack and now had to rearrange expectations and assure ourselves that hiking to Trail Camp (12,000′) with all of our gear was going to be fine.
