This blog post is merely to detail our thinking as we completed our literature review last week. I’ll be posting the lit review on “Open Badging Systems” this week on this blog for public comment. The literature review was a compilation of the relevant literature available on open badging systems and the beginnings of an argument as to why open badges are needed in our specific programs. Let me reiterate that the argument being presented is specifically suited to our needs as faculty (and students) in our program. In our thinking about badges it became apparent that badging systems need to be granular, as well as authentic.\n<p>What follows below is notes, feedback, and photos from our planning and writing sessions. Much of this work details the challenges and process of writing and researching collaboratively. Student names remain in the document with the permission of the students.</p>\n<p><em>We began on Wednesday with reviewing the wonderful, informative sources you gathered. I took the information from the resource document online and created one index card for each fact or quotation. I created a color coding system. Each source was assigned a color and the facts from that source was printed in the corresponding color. So all of the information from the Erin Knight article “Assessing Digital Badges” were written in orange. Through this process, both Carrie and I could easily sort out the information you collected and reorganize the material.</em></p>\n<p><em>We spent Thursday night rereading your sources and brainstorming with regards to the questions Ian asked us.

Quotes defining badges were grouped together; quotes about employment advantages of badges were grouped together, etc. When completing this part, we had absolutely no idea which source the information came from (other than the color) or who from the class had posted the information. We were simply looking at the material on the card and how the material was going to fit into our argument.</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>On Saturday, we typed the quotes into our outline under the sections we had classified the information under.

Before writing a section, we would reread the information and quotes we felt could be used to make our argument. We worked to incorporate as many quotes as possible into each section. With each section, there were many great quotes that we had placed in the section but just did not seem to fit with the flow of the writing.
