It could be a video, lesson plan, storybook, song or anything else!</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One resource that I have found really useful in exploring the divide between public and private sharing has been blogs using <a href=\"https://readwriterespond.com/2017/07/a-guide-to-global2/\">Global2/Edublogs</a>. <a href=\"https://readwriterespond.com/2015/08/blogging-in-the-classroom-a-reflection/\">Students created blogs</a> focusing on a passion. The sites were viewable by other students in the class, but not anybody outside of that. These were all connected by a classroom blog, which was made public. This served as a resource as well as a example. For me, the interconnected nature of these sites allowed students to interact through the Dashboard Reader, helping create something akin to a <a href=\"https://readwriterespond.com/2015/12/creating-deliberate-social-media-space-students-school/\">social media space</a>. Blogs served as a tool to learn with in that students were able to share their ideas and learnings, as well as learn about sharing information, both private and public, and how we interact with this information.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Unit 3 – Information Safety and Security</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>We have shared a few examples of how information can be extracted from data (such as in your images).

Firstly, the machine itself had a keyboard which once pressed ran a signal through a number of variables, including rotors and plugs, which helped to scramble the code. This all depended on a second documented which stipulated how the rotors and plugs were to be set. So in order to break the code you would need both the machine and the current configuration.

When you scroll through the abundance of examples shared in the <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/darkpatterns/\">subreddit community</a> and in <a href=\"https://www.darkpatterns.org/hall-of-shame\">Brignull’s hall of shame</a>, they seem beyond the world of a twelve year old, let alone a five year old. However, it could be argued that so many habits actually stem from what actually happens during the early years and how technology is approached. Thinking about this from the perspective of <a href=\"https://readwriterespond.com/2015/03/the-essential-elements-of-digital-literacies-ter-podcast-review/\">digital literacies</a>, so much time is spent on skillsets, such as being creative and communicative, but mindsets, such as critical and cognitive thinking, are just as important.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5738/21332179175_c5dab9d75c_c.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><figcaption><a href=\"https://flickr.com/photos/aaron_davis/22048700112\">“Mapping the Internet”</a> by <a href=\"https://flickr.com/people/aaron_davis\">mrkrndvs</a> is licensed under <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/\">CC BY-NC-SA</a></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, thinking about patterns in general, the focus at at <strong>F to 2</strong> could be to explore the shapes and colours used in applications. Investigate the ways we represent information about applications using software and digital systems. Use software to create a positive and a negative representation of data. Investigate in-app purchases and the ways users are enticed to sign-up or purchase add-ons for additional features, like stickers and bonuses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In <strong>3 to 4</strong>, students might explore the different types of data engaged with in online spaces. This could include something like <a href=\"https://collect.readwriterespond.com/k-12-digital-classroom-practice-conference-2018/#Blogging\">paper blogs</a> and leaving physical dots to represent engagement. As well as continue to explore the representation of different types of data and information, including the application of ethical and social protocols.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In <strong>5 to 6</strong>, students could form a definition of dark patterns and how they impact users. This could include the developing solutions which demonstrate such patterns. Associated with this, they might develop protocols for how to respond to such patterns.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>FURTHER RESOURCES</h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/405720691/2018-Grayetal-CHI-DarkPatternsUXDesign-pdf\">2018 Grayetal CHI DarkPatternsUXDesign PDF</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://cookieconsentspeed.run/\">Cookie Consent Speed.Run</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Create or find a classroom resource that teaches students about creating strong passwords, passcodes or passphrases.</h3>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\" data-dnt=\"true\" data-theme=\"dark\">\n<p lang=\"und\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://t.co/p5jJd36JIW\">pic.twitter.com/p5jJd36JIW</a></p>— #Leunig Cartoons (@leunigcartoons) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/leunigcartoons/status/1152400988931858434?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 20, 2019</a>\n</blockquote> <script async=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\n\n\n<p>There is so much written about passwords, what makes a strong ones, how to go about maintaining them.

Although a passphrase made using the Diceware method used in association with two-factor authentication may be considered an ideal outcome, the question remains how young learners are supported with building up their <a href=\"https://readwriterespond.com/2015/03/the-essential-elements-of-digital-literacies-ter-podcast-review/\">confidence and constructive</a> capacity to manage such workflows?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In regards to learning activities, there are various resources available, however too often they come across as one-off lessons, a passing of the knowledge akin to the Matrix, rather than a gradual release over time.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-embed-handler wp-block-embed-embed-handler wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Matrix - I Know Kung Fu\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6vMO3XmNXe4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The risk with this approach is that if a student was not there for this one-off experience, then they can miss the transer of knowledge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One person to approach the problem differently is <a href=\"https://audreynay.weebly.com/password-development.html\">Audrey Nay</a>, she has put together a continuum of learning starting at Prep and going to Year 6. The journey starts with a basic passwords letters and ending with a 6 character mnenomic with a mixture of numbers, upper and lower cases, and punctuation. Although I like how she has broken down the sequence of steps across the years, I wonder about the outcome of a 6 character mnenomic, as opposed to a passphrase. As Micah Lee explains:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"quoteback\" darkmode=\"\" data-title=\"Passphrases%20That%20You%20Can%20Memorize%20%E2%80%94%20But%20That%20Even%20the%20NSA%20Can%E2%80%99t%20Guess\" data-author=\"@theintercept\" cite=\"https://theintercept.com/2015/03/26/passphrases-can-memorize-attackers-cant-guess/\">\n<p>Not too bad for a passphrase like “bolt vat frisky fob land hazy rigid,” which is entirely possible for most people to memorize.

An approach could be used where each stage is defined by a different set of questions built up across time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the other challenges to passwords being a ‘once-off’ activity is that such activities are often done <em>to</em> students, rather than with students.

                "value": "Below are my responses associated with the Cyber Security & Awareness – Primary Years (2021) MOOC. As is my way with MOOCs, I have dipped in and out of the course when time allowed.\n\n\n\nUnit 2 – Computer Science Fundamentals\n\n\n\nExplain what you think are some of the key differences between cyber security, cyber awareness and cyber safety. To what extent are you teaching these in the classroom or to what extend do you think they should be taught and why?\n\n\n\nFor me, Cyber Security is about the solutions and services that keep us protected. This might involve people and programs. It can be understood as being a part of what Ursula Franklin described as technology as a system:\n\n\n\n\nTechnology is not the sum of the artefacts, of the wheels and gears, of the rails and electronic transmitters. Technology is a system. It entails far more than its individual material components. Technology involves organization, procedures, symbols, new words, equations, and, most of all, a mindset.\nUrsula Franklin https://www.cbc.ca/radio/ideas/peace-and-justice-a-celebration-of-ursula-franklin-1.3694050\n\n\n\n\nCyber Awareness on the other hand is having some knowledge and understanding of this system and how it fits together, while Cyber Safety is the action of this knowledge and understanding.\n\n\n\nOne way of appreciating this divide is to divide the topic between mindset and skillset. This is something that Doug Belshaw touches upon in his exploration of digital literacies.\n\n\n\n  “The 8 Essential Elements of Digital Literacies #digilit” by mrkrndvs is licensed under CC BY-SA\n\n\n\nFor example, consider an application like Hapara. From the perspective of mindset and understanding:\n\n\n\nCognitively and confidence involves appreciating new ways of working. Although it may be more efficient, if you have been using GSuite, these are still habits to unlearn and relearn.From a critical and civic point of view, it is important to consider why there is a need to manage learning at all and the consequences associated with such actions.\n\n\n\nWhereas from the perspective of skillset and actions:\n\n\n\nFrom a cultural perspective, Hapara posits that teachers are largely responsible for creating the conditions for learning.Constructively, there is a blur between empowering students with the power to participate in actions and the dangers in excessively moderating their learning.From a communicative point of view, GSuite allows a number of ways to engage, Hapara provides the means to manage and moderate this within different cultural norms.Connecting with GSuite through the use of APIs, Hapara has the ability to both hinder and help the creative process depending on how it is deployed.\n\n\n\nI have elaborated this more here.\n\n\n\nShare with the community a way you would like to introduce networks into the classroom to make it tangible or visible for primary students. It could be using a resource you have found or your own idea or thoughts.\n\n\n\nTwo activities that I have used in regards to helping student appreciate networks are paper blogs and mapping the internet.\n\n\n\nPAPER BLOGS\n\n\n\nStudents use the a template to create a paper blog post. They then post it on the World Wide Whiteboard.\n\n\n\n  Paper Blog Template inspired by Bianca Hewes\n\n\n\nStudents then walk around the room and read the posts leaving various data traces, such as:\n\n\n\nTick to mark they had read the post.Star if they liked the post.Sticky Note with a comment\n\n\n\nThis was adapted from the work of Bianca Hewes.\n\n\n\nMAPPING THE INTERNET\n\n\n\nIn response to Marc Prensky published two articles in 2001 in which he coined the terms digital native and digital immigrant, David White and Alison Le Cornu offer a more fluid typology with their notion of digital visitor and resident.\n\n\n\n\nWhen in Visitor mode, individuals decide on the task they wish to undertake. For example, discovering a particular piece of information online, completing the task and then going offline or moving on to another task.\n\n\n\n\nDavid White http://daveowhite.com/vandr/\n\n\n\n\nWhere as:\n\n\n\n\nWhen in Resident mode the individual is going online to connect to, or to be with, other people. This mode is about social presence.\n\n\n\n\nDavid White http://daveowhite.com/vandr/\n\n\n\n\nStudents are given a copy of the the map of the internet and are asked to plot the various spaces they exist in online and where they sit along the continuum.\n\n\n\n  “Mapping the Internet” by mrkrndvs is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA\n\n\n\nThis is activity is useful for thinking about the networks they are a part of and the way in which their data is spread across the web.\n\n\n\nThinking about this activity now, it is interesting to consider this in regards to cyber awareness and what data we share even when we are just ‘visiting’.\n\n\n\nShare an activity idea or classroom resource that you have found online or created yourself that involves primary students exploring private and public information sharing. It could be a video, lesson plan, storybook, song or anything else!\n\n\n\nOne resource that I have found really useful in exploring the divide between public and private sharing has been blogs using Global2/Edublogs. Students created blogs focusing on a passion. The sites were viewable by other students in the class, but not anybody outside of that. These were all connected by a classroom blog, which was made public. This served as a resource as well as a example. For me, the interconnected nature of these sites allowed students to interact through the Dashboard Reader, helping create something akin to a social media space. Blogs served as a tool to learn with in that students were able to share their ideas and learnings, as well as learn about sharing information, both private and public, and how we interact with this information.\n\n\n\nUnit 3 – Information Safety and Security\n\n\n\nWe have shared a few examples of how information can be extracted from data (such as in your images). What are other ways humans can leave traces of information with the use of technologies? Share an example or examples with the community.\n\n\n\nSome other examples of where information can be extracted from data include:\n\n\n\nTest scores, learning artifacts and plagarism software used to make judgement using machine learning.Information surreptitiously shared when using various apps on a smartphone. Even de-identified data can leave a trace.Facial recognition taken from CCT cameras, so of which are open and public.Wearables and the plotting of location data, including secret US Army bases.Genetics tests potentially used to identify supposed taste in music or links to a crime.\n\n\n\nWhat other interesting examples of codes from history or the modern-day (digital or non-digital) can you find to inspire or support a lesson about encoding and decoding messages?\n\n\n\nFor those wanting to go to the next level in regards to encryption could look at the Enigma Machine from World War II.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis coding machine used by the Germans in World War II involved a two step process. Firstly, the machine itself had a keyboard which once pressed ran a signal through a number of variables, including rotors and plugs, which helped to scramble the code. This all depended on a second documented which stipulated how the rotors and plugs were to be set. So in order to break the code you would need both the machine and the current configuration. In some ways this has similarities with private and public encryption, where somebody maybe able to get access to the ‘public’ machine, but unable to make any sense of this without cracking the ‘private’ configuration.\n\n\n\nPaul Scruton has visualised how the Enigma Machine worked in this Guardian infographic:\n\n\n\n Workflow for how the Enigma Machine worked \n\n\n\nWhile Tom MacWright has created a virtual model of the machine which allows the user to not only configure the machine and enter a message to be encrypted, but also follow the signal as it passes through the various stages.\n\n\n\nFind and share a resource to support teaching students in primary years about information sharing or safe communication. Include a brief description.\n\n\n\nCOMMENTING ON BLOGS\n\n\n\nWhen introducing blogging in the classroom, I used to follow up my focus on paper blogs with a focus on commenting and communication. This began with a ‘turn and talk’ about why we communicate online? I would then watch Linda Yollis’ video on quality comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter watching this, students worked together to complete a Found Out, Made Me Think.\n\n\n\nOnce the class had thought about comments, we created a set of guidelines which were then used in the creation of a rubric that students could be used as a reference. To support this students refereed to the Rubric for Rubrics to help them.\n\n\n\n BIE Rubric for Rubrics \n\n\n\nWhat mattered most for me was creating a space where students could learning through the experience of commenting, especially as some of my older boys were already engaging in 4Chan, meme and trolling culture. Therefore, this rubric was something that we returned to regularly as particular situations arose.\n\n\n\nThinking about this now in regards to the challenges of moderation on social media (see posts about YouTube and Facebook), I wonder about extending this by discussing what changes they would make if they were moderating comments for every class in the school (or even whole world) and what a digital solution for this might look like?\n\n\n\nUnit 4 – Internet Security\n\n\n\nWhat are some primary-friendly “scam scenarios” that you could use in the classroom for encouraging students to critically think about messages they receive? Create your own “fake scam” to share with the community so they can try and spot the tell-tale signs!\n\n\n\nRather than Nigerian prince or stranger danger, I think that the best scam that children need to learn to be aware of are the surreptitious scams they learn to live with every day. These are what Harry Brignull coined as ‘dark patterns‘.\n\n\n\nDark Patterns are intentional user interfaces to trick you into doing something. As Brignull explains:\n\n\n\n\nNormally we think of bad design as consisting of laziness, mistakes, or school-boy errors. We refer to these sorts of design patterns as Antipatterns. However, there’s another kind of bad design pattern, one that’s been crafted with great attention to detail, and a solid understanding of human psychology, to trick users into do things they wouldn’t otherwise have done. This is the dark side of design, and since these kind of design patterns don’t have a name, I’m proposing we start calling them Dark Patterns.\n\n@harrybr https://90percentofeverything.com/2010/07/08/dark-patterns-dirty-tricks-designers-use-to-make-people-do-stuff/\n\n\n\n\nIn an interview with Brignull, Per Axbom and James Royal-Lawson provide their own definition of dark patterns as,\n\n\n\n\nA gap between perception of what you are doing and the reality of what you have done. – 30 mins\n\n https://uxpodcast.com/150-dark-patterns-harry-brignull/\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nWhile in Mike Monteiro’s book Ruined by Design, he argues that:\n\n\n\n\nDark patterns are the canaries in the coal mine of unethical design. A company who’s willing to keep a customer hostage is willing to do worse.\nMike Monteiro https://www.ruinedby.design/\n\n\n\n\nArvind Narayanan, Arunesh Mathur, Marshini Chetty, and Mihir Kshirsagar suggest that such patterns have developed over over over time:\n\n\n\n\nAlthough they have recently burst into mainstream awareness, dark patterns are the result of three decades- long trends: one from the world of retail (deceptive practices), one from research and public policy (nudging), and the third from the design community (growth hacking). \n\n https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3400901\n\n\n\n\nHarry Brignull has created a site dedicated to all things dark patterns, including a list of examples:\n\n\n\nTrick questions while filling in a formSneak into the purchase basketRoach motelPrivacy sharingPrice comparison preventionMisdirection and distractionHidden costsBait and switchGuilting users into opting into somethingDisguised adsForced continuityFriend spam\n\n\n\nColin Gray summarises these in a presentation on the dark side of UX design:\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nAlternatively, the research team at UXP2 have broken Brignull’s list down into five particular strategies:\n\n\n\nNaggingObstructionSneakingInterface InterferenceForced Action\n\n\n\nIn the end, Daniel Fitton suggests that what is most important is a critical understanding.\n\n\n\n\nDark design is used to influence our decisions about our time, our money, our personal data and our consent. But a critical understanding of how dark patterns work, and what they’re hoping to achieve, can help us detect and overcome their trickery.\nDaniel Fitton https://theconversation.com/the-rise-of-dark-web-design-how-sites-manipulate-you-into-clicking-168347\n\n\n\n\nThe question is what this all means for young children. When you scroll through the abundance of examples shared in the subreddit community and in Brignull’s hall of shame, they seem beyond the world of a twelve year old, let alone a five year old. However, it could be argued that so many habits actually stem from what actually happens during the early years and how technology is approached. Thinking about this from the perspective of digital literacies, so much time is spent on skillsets, such as being creative and communicative, but mindsets, such as critical and cognitive thinking, are just as important.\n\n\n\n  “Mapping the Internet” by mrkrndvs is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA\n\n\n\nTherefore, thinking about patterns in general, the focus at at F to 2 could be to explore the shapes and colours used in applications. Investigate the ways we represent information about applications using software and digital systems. Use software to create a positive and a negative representation of data. Investigate in-app purchases and the ways users are enticed to sign-up or purchase add-ons for additional features, like stickers and bonuses.\n\n\n\nIn 3 to 4, students might explore the different types of data engaged with in online spaces. This could include something like paper blogs and leaving physical dots to represent engagement. As well as continue to explore the representation of different types of data and information, including the application of ethical and social protocols.\n\n\n\nIn 5 to 6, students could form a definition of dark patterns and how they impact users. This could include the developing solutions which demonstrate such patterns. Associated with this, they might develop protocols for how to respond to such patterns.\n\n\n\nFURTHER RESOURCES\n\n\n\n2018 Grayetal CHI DarkPatternsUXDesign PDFCookie Consent Speed.Run\n\n\n\nCreate or find a classroom resource that teaches students about creating strong passwords, passcodes or passphrases.\n\n\n\npic.twitter.com/p5jJd36JIW— #Leunig Cartoons (@leunigcartoons) July 20, 2019 \n\n\n\nThere is so much written about passwords, what makes a strong ones, how to go about maintaining them. For example, the Twinkl team recommends six rules:\n\n\n\ninclude numbers, letters and symbolsuse at least one capital lettermake it something you will remember but others won’t think ofmake sure it has eight characters or morenever use obvious names or datesnever write down or share your password\n\n\n\nWhile Charlotte Empey’s provides the following tips:\n\n\n\nStay away from the obviousMake it longUse a mix of charactersAvoid common substitutionsDon’t use memorable keyboard pathsAvoid using single words\n\n\n\nAssociated with these tips, she puts forward some particular strategies:\n\n\n\nRevised passphrase method where you compose a phrase using bizarre and uncommon words a phrase that gives you a mental image.The sentence method combines a random sentence with a rule that makes it gobbledegook.Muscle memory method where a random group of characters is memorised as a pattern.\n\n\n\nMicah Lee elaborates on the discussion of passphrases, discussing the Diceware method:\n\n\n\n\nFirst, grab a copy of the Diceware word list, which contains 7,776 English words — 37 pages for those of you printing at home. You’ll notice that next to each word is a five-digit number, with each digit between 1 and 6. Here’s a small excerpt from the word list:\n\n24456 eo\n24461 ep\n24462 epa\n24463 epic\n24464 epoch\n\nNow grab some six-sided dice (yes, actual real physical dice) and roll them several times, writing down the numbers that you get. You’ll need a total of five dice rolls to come up with the first word in your passphrase. What you’re doing here is generating entropy, extracting true randomness from nature and turning it into numbers.\nIf you roll the number two, then four, then four again, then six, then three, and then look up in the Diceware word list 24463, you’ll see the word “epic.” That will be the first word in your passphrase. Now repeat. You want to come up with a seven-word passphrase if you’re worried about the NSA or Chinese spies someday trying to guess it (more on the logic behind this number below).\nUsing Diceware, you end up with passphrases that look like “cap liz donna demon self,” “bang vivo thread duct knob train,” and “brig alert rope welsh foss rang orb.” If you want a stronger passphrase you can use more words; if a weaker passphrase is OK for your purpose you can use less words.\n@theintercept https://theintercept.com/2015/03/26/passphrases-can-memorize-attackers-cant-guess/\n\n\n\n\nIn Richard Barnes’ guide to safer logins, he suggests\n\n\n\nUse random passwords, and use a different password for every siteUse a password manager to make creating and remembering passwords easierMake your answers to security questions just as strong as your passwordsUse “two-factor authentication” wherever you canPay attention to the browser’s security signals, and be suspicious\n\n\n\nElaborating on two factor authentication,  Chris Betcher explains it as ‘something you have and something you know‘:\n\n\n\n\nThe something you know is the password, and yes it’s still a good idea to have a strong password, something with enough length and complexity that is hard to guess but easy to remember.  But it’s not enough. It’s just one factor.\n\n\n\nThe second factor is something you have, or something you physically carry with you, such as a phone or touch key. Unless the hacker or foreign power actually has your phone, they can’t access your data, even if they know your password.  Just like the two keys for the front door, they need both your password AND your phone at the same time. If they have both those things, you may just have bigger problems to deal with.\n\n\n\n\n http://chrisbetcher.com/2020/03/something-you-know-something-you-have/\n\n\n\n\nAll this advice is helpful, but not necessarily practical for young learners. Although a passphrase made using the Diceware method used in association with two-factor authentication may be considered an ideal outcome, the question remains how young learners are supported with building up their confidence and constructive capacity to manage such workflows?\n\n\n\nIn regards to learning activities, there are various resources available, however too often they come across as one-off lessons, a passing of the knowledge akin to the Matrix, rather than a gradual release over time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe risk with this approach is that if a student was not there for this one-off experience, then they can miss the transer of knowledge.\n\n\n\nOne person to approach the problem differently is Audrey Nay, she has put together a continuum of learning starting at Prep and going to Year 6. The journey starts with a basic passwords letters and ending with a 6 character mnenomic with a mixture of numbers, upper and lower cases, and punctuation. Although I like how she has broken down the sequence of steps across the years, I wonder about the outcome of a 6 character mnenomic, as opposed to a passphrase. As Micah Lee explains:\n\n\n\n\nNot too bad for a passphrase like “bolt vat frisky fob land hazy rigid,” which is entirely possible for most people to memorize. Compare that to “d07;oj7MgLz’%v,” a random password that contains slightly less entropy than the seven-word Diceware passphrase but is significantly more difficult to memorize.\n\n@theintercept https://theintercept.com/2015/03/26/passphrases-can-memorize-attackers-cant-guess/\n\n\n\n\nIn regards to passphrases, Ian Addison talks about getting younger students to combine two unrelated words that they can spell, while the eSafety team suggest providing multiple columns, where students choose one option from each. I wonder if a useful approach is to start with one word chosen from a simple list and progressively build up to something like four words taken from a more complicated list of words.\n\n\n\nSupporting the process of reflection, passwords resource developed in conjunction with Code.org and Common Sense Media flips the various requirements into a series of statements. An approach could be used where each stage is defined by a different set of questions built up across time.\n\n\n\nOne of the other challenges to passwords being a ‘once-off’ activity is that such activities are often done to students, rather than with students. This often stems from the ramifications of poor passwords. For example, sometimes platforms have built-in feedback mechanisms that force users to enter a number, character and symbol. Also, based on logistics passwords are often managed for students using generators like Dinopass or Google Sheet tempaltes.  Digital Technologies Hub’s answer to this is to go beyond a mere list of rules, suggesting that students create an artefact (i.e. a poster) explaining their understanding. Alternatively, sites like How Secure is My Password can be useful to support students for testing processes.\n\n\n\nThis all has me thinking about alternatives for logging in, such as the use of biometric information, patterns and images. I wonder what ‘passwords’ might look like for students in ten years time?\n\n\n\nShare your thoughts on what you imagine to be the future of cyber attacks. Consider the types of information we store and share online today. What information will hackers try to get in the future? What approaches do you think they will use?\n\n\n\nI think the future of hacking and cyber attacks is the linking of different datasets that we openly share online through data brokers to provide an insight and awareness of individuals that will open up new possibilities.\n\n\n\n\nThese companies often acquire the information through purchase, licensing, or other sharing agreements with third parties. Oracle, for example, “owns and works with” over 80 data brokers, according to a 2019 Financial Times report, aggregating information on everything from consumer shopping to internet behavior. However, many companies also scrape data that is publicly viewable on the internet and then aggregate it for sale or sharing. “People search” websites often fall into this latter category—compiling public records (property filings, court documents, voting registrations, etc.) on individuals and then letting anyone on the internet search for their information.\nJustin Sherman https://www.wired.com/story/opinion-data-brokers-are-a-threat-to-democracy/\n\n\n\n\nThis impact is only amplified by the influx of connected devices and online accounts.\n\n\n\nUnit 5 – Cyber Ethics\n\n\n\nFind a resource (a website, video or storybook) for teaching a topic related to cyber ethics and share this with the community. Provide a brief explanation.\n\n\n\nA useful post I have found in regards to cyber citizenship (and ethics) is Kathleen Morris’s Teaching Digital Citizenship: 10 Internet Safety Tips For Students (With Posters). Morris outlines her four layered approach to teaching digital citizenship. This focuses on integrating the various skills within the curriculum, providing real world stories to reflect upon, building up student toolkits and developing lines of communication.

Every successful band has the moment when they almost gave up just before their breakthrough; every artistic movement has its rejections, arguments, and fistfights; every book has a graveyard of characters and scenes that were killed to make way for the story.

That’s perhaps why it never did much for me, because I’d sort of heard it all already.

Instead, it captures the rise of bands such as The Birthday Party, The Saints, The Triffids, The Hard Ons, The Beasts of Bourbon and The Go-Betweens. As well as the many other bands and artists who seemingly came and went.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of things that stood out to me were:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>How fluid, volatile and connected tge scene seemed to be. Often one band would demise only to have members pop-up in another band, if they were not already in more than one band.</li>\n<li>Hearing some of this music was incredibly hard. Whereas these days we might go online to listen or purchase new music, finding some of these pressings would have involved going to a handful of niche record stores.</li>\n<li>Place of covers. With so many bands forming on a whim, covers seem to play an important role in filling out a set or helping to define a bands sound. I feel that Walker’s latest book, <a href=\"https://www.clintonwalker.com.au/suburban-songbook.html\">Suburban Songbook</a>, might have more to say on this.</li>\n<li>How many moving parts there were and are. It can be easy to think that success is all just about the music, but there are so many other parts at play. Whether it be the labels, the record stores, the local radio stations, the magazines, the venues, the promoters, the managers, the producers. Each play their own particular part in the rise and fall.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>What amazes me about this book is that Walker was able to remember what he did. As he posits:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"quoteback\" cite=\"https://www.clintonwalker.com.au/stranded.html\" data-title=\"Stranded\" data-author=\"Clinton Walker\">They say that if you remember the ’60s you can’t have been there.

Grunge, the defining Sub Pop/Seattle Sound of Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Pearl Jam and Nirvana, was basically the sound of Australia’s ’80s underground—the Scientists, the Cosmic Psychos, even the Birthday Party, and bands like Feedtime, Grong Grong, Lubricated Goat and Bloodloss—mixed up with classic early metal, classic early punk and, I’d now add, AC/DC and Neil Young’s Crazy Horse.\n\nClinton Walker https://www.clintonwalker.com.au/stranded.html\n\n\n\n\nNot only was Walker there for much of it, but he was a part of it as well.\n\n\n\nStranded is, for better or worse, simply my version of a history.\n\nClinton Walker https://www.clintonwalker.com.au/stranded.html\n\n\n\n\nIt goes beyond the world of Countdown, Farnsey and Barnsey, Michael Gudinski and the pub rock scene. Instead, it captures the rise of bands such as The Birthday Party, The Saints, The Triffids, The Hard Ons, The Beasts of Bourbon and The Go-Betweens. As well as the many other bands and artists who seemingly came and went.\n\n\n\nSome of things that stood out to me were:\n\n\n\nHow fluid, volatile and connected tge scene seemed to be. Often one band would demise only to have members pop-up in another band, if they were not already in more than one band.Hearing some of this music was incredibly hard. Whereas these days we might go online to listen or purchase new music, finding some of these pressings would have involved going to a handful of niche record stores.Place of covers. With so many bands forming on a whim, covers seem to play an important role in filling out a set or helping to define a bands sound. I feel that Walker’s latest book, Suburban Songbook, might have more to say on this.How many moving parts there were and are. It can be easy to think that success is all just about the music, but there are so many other parts at play. Whether it be the labels, the record stores, the local radio stations, the magazines, the venues, the promoters, the managers, the producers. Each play their own particular part in the rise and fall.\n\n\n\nWhat amazes me about this book is that Walker was able to remember what he did. As he posits:\n\n\n\nThey say that if you remember the ’60s you can’t have been there. So much about the ’80s I can’t remember either. My journalism brings a lot back; I can’t help wondering if the rest isn’t best forgotten.\n\nClinton Walker https://www.clintonwalker.com.au/stranded.html\n\n\n\n\nI guess the task of remembering is often ruefully aided with snipets from the artists in question that help provide further perspective and fill out some of the gaps.\n\n\n\nThere is so much more that I would love to know. This was the feeling I had after listening to Damian Cowell too. However, as Walker suggests, maybe sometimes it is best left forgotten.\n\r\n\r\n If you enjoy what you read here, feel free to sign up for my monthly newsletter to catch up on all things learning, edtech and storytelling."

Pragmatic genealogies prove themselves not through the detailed accuracy with which they depict the actual historical development of our concepts, but through the way in which they help us grasp connections between our practical needs and our concepts. Imagine having to explain to an alien why your car has the shape it does. Instead of painstakingly walking the alien through the stages of the assembly line on which the car was actually constructed, you could explain how its shape answers to a combination of practical needs: the need to move from A to B, the need to stay warm and dry, the need to steer and brake, the need to have a good view of your surroundings, the need to see and be seen in the dark, etc. The best way to show how the car’s shape is responsive to our needs isn’t to work through the distractingly intricate causal process through which the car was actually constructed, but to reconstruct the car’s shape as a response to a series of needs – perhaps through a narrative or an animation showing how, if we start from some primitive shape and successively warp it to meet a series of needs, we end up with something recognisably car-like. The State of Nature does the same to help us understand the shape of our concepts and their relation to our needs. It offers us an idealised, uncluttered model that we can tailor to our interests and tinker with in our imagination.\n\n<footer>aeonmag<cite> <a href=\"https://aeon.co/essays/our-most-abstract-concepts-emerged-as-solutions-to-our-needs\">https://aeon.co/essays/our-most-abstract-concepts-emerged-as-solutions-to-our-needs</a></cite></footer>\n</blockquote>\n<script note=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Blogger-Peer-Review/quotebacks@1/quoteback.js\"></script>\n<blockquote class=\"quoteback\" cite=\"https://austinkleon.com/2021/06/22/bad-ideas-get-stolen-plenty/\" data-title=\"Bad%20ideas%20get%20stolen%20plenty%20-%20Austin%20Kleon\" data-author=\"\">Ideas only travel as far as the minds ready and willing to take them in.\n\n<footer><cite> <a href=\"https://austinkleon.com/2021/06/22/bad-ideas-get-stolen-plenty/\">https://austinkleon.com/2021/06/22/bad-ideas-get-stolen-plenty/</a></cite></footer>\n</blockquote>\n<script note=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Blogger-Peer-Review/quotebacks@1/quoteback.js\"></script>\n<blockquote class=\"quoteback\" cite=\"https://seths.blog/2021/05/identity-and-ideas/\" data-title=\"Identity%20and%20ideas\" data-author=\"@ThisIsSethsBlog\">One way to define our identity is to fall in love with an idea (often one that was handed to us by a chosen authority).

In part for ideas, but really for solace.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, having felt like 2021 was something of a right-off in regards to achieving my own desired outcomes, I was not sure about 2022.  Like Austin Kleon, I feel <a href=\"https://austinkleon.com/2021/04/26/im-not-languishing-im-dormant/\">dormant</a>. I therefore thought having a focus was not a priority. I thought then that instead of having a word with particular outcomes perceived, I would instead return to a meditation on a theme or topic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the strange things about the current malaise is that I feel like I both have too much time to think and too little time to do anything.

Associated with this, I started reading <a href=\"https://collect.readwriterespond.com/swanns-way-marcel-proust/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Marcel Proust’s In Search of Lost Time</a>. This only furthered my reflections on the past. I therefore decided that my word for 2022 would be <strong>memories</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether it be reading more memoirs, such as <a href=\"https://collect.readwriterespond.com/lolly-scramble-tony-martin/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Tony Martin’s Lolly Scramble</a>, writing reflections of my own, such as my post on <a href=\"https://readwriterespond.com/2019/11/changing-tracks/\">Changing Tracks</a>, or simply diving into the idea of memories in general. I am going to dedicate this year to letting go of setting stringent expectations on myself and commit myself to letting my mind just wonder. <a href=\"https://collect.readwriterespond.com/start-often-fk-achievements/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Start often, finish rarely</a>? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what about you?

Instead of painstakingly walking the alien through the stages of the assembly line on which the car was actually constructed, you could explain how its shape answers to a combination of practical needs: the need to move from A to B, the need to stay warm and dry, the need to steer and brake, the need to have a good view of your surroundings, the need to see and be seen in the dark, etc. The best way to show how the car’s shape is responsive to our needs isn’t to work through the distractingly intricate causal process through which the car was actually constructed, but to reconstruct the car’s shape as a response to a series of needs – perhaps through a narrative or an animation showing how, if we start from some primitive shape and successively warp it to meet a series of needs, we end up with something recognisably car-like. The State of Nature does the same to help us understand the shape of our concepts and their relation to our needs. It offers us an idealised, uncluttered model that we can tailor to our interests and tinker with in our imagination.\n\naeonmag https://aeon.co/essays/our-most-abstract-concepts-emerged-as-solutions-to-our-needs\n\nIdeas only travel as far as the minds ready and willing to take them in.\n\n https://austinkleon.com/2021/06/22/bad-ideas-get-stolen-plenty/\n\nOne way to define our identity is to fall in love with an idea (often one that was handed to us by a chosen authority). Another is to refuse to believe our identity is embodied in an idea, and instead embrace a method for continually finding and improving our ideas.\n\n@ThisIsSethsBlog https://seths.blog/2021/05/identity-and-ideas/\n\nHere is an idea I love that may or may not be true:\n\nSome books have a centripetal force— they suck you in from other books.\n\nSome books have a centrifugal force — they spin you out to other books.\n\n https://austinkleon.com/2021/03/29/books-that-suck-you-in-and-books-that-spin-you-out/\n\n\n\n\nIn the end, I actually ended up committing myself to a return to reading (or listening to books). In part for ideas, but really for solace.\n\n\n\nTherefore, having felt like 2021 was something of a right-off in regards to achieving my own desired outcomes, I was not sure about 2022.  Like Austin Kleon, I feel dormant. I therefore thought having a focus was not a priority. I thought then that instead of having a word with particular outcomes perceived, I would instead return to a meditation on a theme or topic.\n\n\n\nOne of the strange things about the current malaise is that I feel like I both have too much time to think and too little time to do anything. Listening to Damian Cowell’s podcast associated with his album involving diving into his early years, I was led down my own rabbit hole. Associated with this, I started reading Marcel Proust’s In Search of Lost Time. This only furthered my reflections on the past. I therefore decided that my word for 2022 would be memories.\n\n\n\nWhether it be reading more memoirs, such as Tony Martin’s Lolly Scramble, writing reflections of my own, such as my post on Changing Tracks, or simply diving into the idea of memories in general. I am going to dedicate this year to letting go of setting stringent expectations on myself and commit myself to letting my mind just wonder. Start often, finish rarely? \n\n\n\nSo what about you? Have you got a word or any thoughts on memory. As always, comments welcome.\n\r\n\r\n If you enjoy what you read here, feel free to sign up for my monthly newsletter to catch up on all things learning, edtech and storytelling."

This folder also included a number of folders within folders, which created a level of complexity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The current workflow involved using an Add-on <a href=\"https://support.awesome-table.com/hc/en-us/sections/115001613905-File-Cabinet\" class=\"broken_link\" rel=\"nofollow\">File Cabinet</a> from the developers behind <a href=\"https://readwriterespond.com/2017/05/awesome-reading-list-edublogsclub/\">Awesome Table</a> to generate a list. The problem with this list is that the exported data was not in the desired format. Whereas the output focused on file, folder and link, the list produced using File Cabinet included other information such as owner, creation date and file size. In addition to that, there were some folders and files listed that needed to be removed. Therefore, it had become manual heavy exercise to refresh the data and update the directory meaning it did not happen that regularly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After looking at the list and the current finished product and the list produced using File Cabinet, I realised that rather than displaying the sub-folder, that the directory was showing a top level folder.

                "value": "I was recently asked to have a look at spreadsheet that listed all the guides and videos located in a support folder as a reference. This folder also included a number of folders within folders, which created a level of complexity.\n\n\n\nThe current workflow involved using an Add-on File Cabinet from the developers behind Awesome Table to generate a list. The problem with this list is that the exported data was not in the desired format. Whereas the output focused on file, folder and link, the list produced using File Cabinet included other information such as owner, creation date and file size. In addition to that, there were some folders and files listed that needed to be removed. Therefore, it had become manual heavy exercise to refresh the data and update the directory meaning it did not happen that regularly.\n\n\n\nAfter looking at the list and the current finished product and the list produced using File Cabinet, I realised that rather than displaying the sub-folder, that the directory was showing a top level folder. Therefore to manage this, I used a SWITCH formula to create a new column updating the folder name to the overall area it belonged to.\n\n\n\nTo create the SWITCH, I created a UNIQUE list of all the folders and then pasted them as values so that I could delete those not required to be displayed in the directory.

I then import the absence data exported from the external system. Although I could possibly copy and paste the data, I have found that this is fraught with dangers. In regards to the ‘Import Location’ I select Insert New Sheet(s). This then loads the new data into Sheet1. I then click on the formula in Sheet2!A1 and press enter to refresh the QUERY formula and populate the rest of the spreadsheet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those interested, a copy of the spreadsheet can be found <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UJIWMdb0B1L4RIC07uOwnSGQ5Vrofm3390ggGA6PfF8/copy\">here</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>—</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Growing up, I never really went deep into the world Microsoft Excel. It was not until exploring Google Sheets that I started appreciating the power and potentials. One of the consequences of this is that a lot of the habits that I have learnt are not applicable in reverse. For example, Ben Collins has a site discussing the power of moving from <a href=\"https://exceltosheets.com/guide/#functions\">Excel to Google Sheets</a>. This includes a discussion of IMPORT features and the QUERY function. However, there is nothing that I am aware of that goes the other way. I guess this is the nature of coding in general. Every language has its own set of affordances and we work within these constraints. What the situation has taught me though is that sometimes solving problems is about working with what is at hand. I guess the challenge is developing our box of tricks so that we do have something at hand.

I then import the absence data exported from the external system. Although I could possibly copy and paste the data, I have found that this is fraught with dangers. In regards to the ‘Import Location’ I select Insert New Sheet(s). This then loads the new data into Sheet1. I then click on the formula in Sheet2!A1 and press enter to refresh the QUERY formula and populate the rest of the spreadsheet.\n\n\n\nFor those interested, a copy of the spreadsheet can be found here. \n\n\n\n—\n\n\n\nGrowing up, I never really went deep into the world Microsoft Excel. It was not until exploring Google Sheets that I started appreciating the power and potentials. One of the consequences of this is that a lot of the habits that I have learnt are not applicable in reverse. For example, Ben Collins has a site discussing the power of moving from Excel to Google Sheets. This includes a discussion of IMPORT features and the QUERY function. However, there is nothing that I am aware of that goes the other way. I guess this is the nature of coding in general. Every language has its own set of affordances and we work within these constraints. What the situation has taught me though is that sometimes solving problems is about working with what is at hand. I guess the challenge is developing our box of tricks so that we do have something at hand. In some ways, this reminds me of something Amy Burvall once said:\n\n\n\n“in order to connect dots, one must first have the dots”\n\nAmy Burvall https://amysmooc.wordpress.com/2017/08/06/rawthought-on-ditching-the-dangerous-dichotomy-between-content-knowledge-and-creativity/\n\n\n\n\nSo what about you? What small tools have you created to solve a particular problem? What are the strategies that you use to continually add to your toolbox so that you are always ready when a problem may arise? As always, comments and webmentions welcome.\n\r\n\r\n If you enjoy what you read here, feel free to sign up for my monthly newsletter to catch up on all things learning, edtech and storytelling."
