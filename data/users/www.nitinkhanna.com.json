After all, there are hundreds, if not thousands, of amazing coffee vendors all over the internet vying for our attention. They arguably even have better, cheaper product.</p>\n<p>But I won‚Äôt belie Nespresso the quality of their products. After all, it‚Äôs their machine that I use to brew my coffee. So they‚Äôve got to know what works best with it, right? </p>\n<p>Besides, I recently ordered a box set of Nespresso pods. So the first five reviews (probably, unless I get bored and order something different) are going to be of Nespresso pods. Here goes.</p>\n<h4>The <a href=\"https://www.nespresso.com/us/en/order/capsules/original/ispirazione-genova-coffee-capsule\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Nespresso Livanto</a>\n</h4>\n<p>Ah, this coffee was smooth. Too smooth! Those ten pods vanished fast. Partly because it‚Äôs a six on thirteen medium roast (point of order ‚Äì Nespresso‚Äôs rating system is out of thirteen.)</p>\n<p>The taste was rich and smooth. I didn‚Äôt bother having it black, but I reckon it would have been creamy and absolutely drinkable. But throw in milk and sugar and it was quite glorious! </p>\n<p>Since it was a medium roast, I ended up having it two at a time for my afternoon coffees. At three pods a day, I finished the box in about three days. I had to brew a Moka pot with my Indian coffee for the fourth day, to get through the afternoon.</p>\n<p>At almost a dollar per pod (eighty cents, to be precise), these pods are at the expensive end of the range of OriginalLine pods I buy for my machine. Though, if I had a VertuoLine machine, I‚Äôd be averaging a dollar twenty five for similar pods. I seem to remember doing that research when considering which machine to buy. My Breville Nespresso Creatista won on that aspect.</p>\n<p>I don‚Äôt have much else to say about this coffee. It was nice. It went fast. I‚Äôd definitely order more of it and keep it for light-coffee-drinking visitors. But usually, I end up serving them decaf or whatever other medium roast I have sitting around.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"alignleft size-large is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.nitinkhanna.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/img_1746.png?resize=426%2C399&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10706\" width=\"426\" height=\"399\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.nitinkhanna.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/img_1746.png?resize=1800%2C1690&amp;ssl=1 1800w, https://i0.wp.com/www.nitinkhanna.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/img_1746.png?resize=300%2C282&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.nitinkhanna.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/img_1746.png?resize=768%2C721&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.nitinkhanna.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/img_1746.png?resize=1536%2C1442&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/www.nitinkhanna.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/img_1746.png?resize=2048%2C1923&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/www.nitinkhanna.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/img_1746.png?resize=700%2C657&amp;ssl=1 700w, https://i0.wp.com/www.nitinkhanna.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/img_1746.png?w=1400&amp;ssl=1 1400w, https://i0.wp.com/www.nitinkhanna.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/img_1746.png?w=2100&amp;ssl=1 2100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></figure>\n</div>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">I will say ‚Äì I love the aluminum pods Nespresso ships.

They arguably even have better, cheaper product.\nBut I won‚Äôt belie Nespresso the quality of their products. After all, it‚Äôs their machine that I use to brew my coffee. So they‚Äôve got to know what works best with it, right? \nBesides, I recently ordered a box set of Nespresso pods. So the first five reviews (probably, unless I get bored and order something different) are going to be of Nespresso pods. Here goes.\nThe Nespresso Livanto\nAh, this coffee was smooth. Too smooth! Those ten pods vanished fast. Partly because it‚Äôs a six on thirteen medium roast (point of order ‚Äì Nespresso‚Äôs rating system is out of thirteen.)\nThe taste was rich and smooth. I didn‚Äôt bother having it black, but I reckon it would have been creamy and absolutely drinkable. But throw in milk and sugar and it was quite glorious! \nSince it was a medium roast, I ended up having it two at a time for my afternoon coffees. At three pods a day, I finished the box in about three days. I had to brew a Moka pot with my Indian coffee for the fourth day, to get through the afternoon.\nAt almost a dollar per pod (eighty cents, to be precise), these pods are at the expensive end of the range of OriginalLine pods I buy for my machine. Though, if I had a VertuoLine machine, I‚Äôd be averaging a dollar twenty five for similar pods. I seem to remember doing that research when considering which machine to buy. My Breville Nespresso Creatista won on that aspect.\nI don‚Äôt have much else to say about this coffee. It was nice. It went fast. I‚Äôd definitely order more of it and keep it for light-coffee-drinking visitors. But usually, I end up serving them decaf or whatever other medium roast I have sitting around.\n\n  \nI will say ‚Äì I love the aluminum pods Nespresso ships. The color, the shape, the solidity of the pod, are all plus points in experience. These ones have a beautiful caramel color and I‚Äôm all for it!\nRead about my Coffee Notes series in the introductory blog post here."

Apparently, he affected everything from both our major systems of early childhood education ‚Äì kindergarten and montessori, to innumerable philosophers, writers (Tolstoy, Byron, Shelley, Keats, Thoreau, Kant, Schopenhauer), and the Romantic movement. He even made it fashionable to climb mountains and explore the great outdoors in Europe as well as to have gardens that look more natural than manicured perfections.

The somewhat uneven-handed remarks and accolades to everything European being the ‚Äúbest‚Äù and the ‚Äúgreatest in the world‚Äù, the unnecessary descriptions of the visages of the persons described, and the somewhat abrupt ending, with only allusions to the excesses of the revolution, are all the faults of the book.\nBut I cannot thank the authors enough for giving me a springboard to leap off of. I have some semblance of an idea of where to start my next reading from, even though it‚Äôll be a while before I come back to anything regarding history. For now, I‚Äôve got quite a lineup of audiobooks to work through, from Andy Weir‚Äôs Project Hail Mary to a collection of short stories by amazing authors as Kate Chopin, Virginia Woolf, and Mary Shelley. I think I‚Äôll stay in the fiction lane for some time, till the call of history, philosophy, and the story of our civilization rises again.\nRegarding the titular man ‚Äì Rousseau ‚Äì well, first of all, this book taught me how to write his name! It also told me of how terrible the person was in his personal life ‚Äì how cruel to his own children (none of whom he raised himself or welcomed into his home), how callous towards his long time lover and wife, how immature and suspicious of his friends. But also, how brilliant in his writing, how influential in thought, and how deeply rooted our current world is in his ideas. Apparently, he affected everything from both our major systems of early childhood education ‚Äì kindergarten and montessori, to innumerable philosophers, writers (Tolstoy, Byron, Shelley, Keats, Thoreau, Kant, Schopenhauer), and the Romantic movement. He even made it fashionable to climb mountains and explore the great outdoors in Europe as well as to have gardens that look more natural than manicured perfections. In an upcoming blog post, I argue that the writings matter, not the writer. As much as I‚Äôve come to despise the man, this is true for Rousseau ‚Äì he was an influential writer and thinker, even though he was a horrible little man.\nBook timeline ‚Äì Jul 22nd 2022 -> Jan 24th 2023\nFormat ‚Äì audiobook\nLength ‚Äì 57 hours 22 minutes \nTonight‚Äôs iPhone wallpaper is the Pale Blue Dot, where everyone ever has lived and died, mostly unnoticed by the rest of the solar system, let alone the galaxy or the universe."

Of these, <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://teadragonsociety.com/\" target=\"_blank\">The Tea Dragon Society</a> was in webcomic form while the rest were eBooks from the Seattle Public Library.</p>\n<p>I also got in two audiobooks ‚Äì <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.worldcat.org/title/1007559349\" target=\"_blank\">My Year of Rest and Relaxation</a> and <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.worldcat.org/title/1041202358\" target=\"_blank\">Figuring</a></p>\n<p>Not bad considering this is also the year my Little One was born and who is right now scurrying across the floor of our apartment, looking for things to attack!</p>\n<p>I read most of the graphic novels in the middle of the year and in Fall, when my reading seemed to have slowed down to a snails pace.

I‚Äôm halfway through <em>Rousseau</em>‚Ä¶ and <em>Worm</em>‚Ä¶ well, by the author‚Äôs own admission, <em>Worm</em> is ‚Äúroughly 1,680,000 words; roughly 26 typical novels in length (or 10-11 very thick novels)‚Äù, so I‚Äôm a ways away from closing that book. Perhaps these will be added to my finished list next year.</p>\n<p>This year, I depended a lot on Seattle Public Library. I loved discovering audiobooks, graphic novels, and eBooks from them.

                "value": "photo of library with turned on lights \nThere‚Äôs a beautiful blanket of snow outside, so it‚Äôs a good time to review how the year went.\nI read thirteen books this year, though ‚Äúread‚Äù is a loosely based concept now. A large part of my reading nowadays is graphic novels, audiobooks, and web novellas.\nBut I do consider all of this reading. It‚Äôs the transmission of ideas based on the written word, even if it‚Äôs accompanied by pictures (or largely based on them) or read by someone into my ear. So, I‚Äôve read thirteen books this year.\nOf these, only two were print ‚Äì Earthlings, and Incredible Doom vol 1.\nNine were digital ‚Äì The Missing Piece Meets the Big O, ‚ÄúTeen Titans: Raven‚Äù, Cyclopedia Exotica, Turtles All the Way Down, Wallace the Brave, Bloom, Big Mushy Happy Lump, The Tea Dragon Society, and The Boy, the Mole, the Fox, and the Horse. Of these, The Tea Dragon Society was in webcomic form while the rest were eBooks from the Seattle Public Library.\nI also got in two audiobooks ‚Äì My Year of Rest and Relaxation and Figuring\nNot bad considering this is also the year my Little One was born and who is right now scurrying across the floor of our apartment, looking for things to attack!\nI read most of the graphic novels in the middle of the year and in Fall, when my reading seemed to have slowed down to a snails pace. Getting a few small or quick reads under my belt made me feel better and allowed me to begin reading some larger works, which I‚Äôm still working through.\nRight now I‚Äôm reading the web novel Worm and listening to Rousseau and Revolution, and these are both long enough that I‚Äôll not be done any time soon. I‚Äôm halfway through Rousseau‚Ä¶ and Worm‚Ä¶ well, by the author‚Äôs own admission, Worm is ‚Äúroughly 1,680,000 words; roughly 26 typical novels in length (or 10-11 very thick novels)‚Äù, so I‚Äôm a ways away from closing that book. Perhaps these will be added to my finished list next year.\nThis year, I depended a lot on Seattle Public Library. I loved discovering audiobooks, graphic novels, and eBooks from them. Whatever I really wanted to read and wasn‚Äôt available immediately there, I found on audible or Thriftbooks.\nI own a physical copy of Figuring. But the book is massive and the writing dense. It really gave itself to being an audiobook in a perfect way. The ideas that came from it though‚Ä¶ I wish I could bookmark every page of the book! Figuring deals heavily with the Transcendentalists and women authors, philosophers, and scientists, and introduced me to the concept of Salons.

The writing is interesting, but I was already being pulled in other directions. I‚Äôve learnt a new term this year ‚Äì DNF ‚Äì Did Not Finish. People seem to use it like ‚ÄúI DNF‚Äôd this book‚Äù. \nSo, here‚Äôs a list of books I DNF‚Äôd this year ‚Äì \n\nSilent Spring\nBraiding Sweetgrass\nAll the Sad Young Literary Men\nUnder the Sea Wind\nPlato and a Platypus Walk into a Bar\nPhilosophy ‚Äì a Visual Encyclopedia\nSouth\nThe World of Edena\nRepresentative Men\nThus Spoke Zarathustra\nThank You for Arguing\nEnola Holmes Graphic Novel, Book 1\nAccidentally Wes Anderson\nThe Map of Knowledge\nAbstract City\nReality+\nIrish Fairy Tales\nAll the Names They Used for God\n\nLet me know if you, dear reader, would like links to any of the above.
