I got 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 prob­lems but an Epochalypse ain’t one \nFollow-​up: Paul Bennett on Facebook asks, ​“When are we going to move to 128-​bit signed inte­ger epoch sec­onds with a 128-​bit IEEE 754 float­ing point off­set in sec­onds?”\nI’m not sure how use­ful quadruple-​precision float­ing point sec­onds are, but as for epoch sec­onds, Trond Endrestøl con­clud­ed in a March 2015 blog that we would need to move by ear­ly December in the year 292,277,026,596. It would­n’t be much of a year, though, as the sun will have long ago engulfed the Earth (so how do you mea­sure a year?), our entire Local Group of galax­ies will have merged into one super-​galaxy, and all the oth­er galax­ies will have reced­ed out­side the observ­able uni­verse.\nSo 292 gigayears should be enough for any­one (that’s still rec­og­niz­ably human), just as 640 kilo­bytes was once ​“enough for any­one”."

I recov­ered it from anoth­er serv­er and am sav­ing it on my blog for posterity.]\nLast week the research lab­o­ra­to­ry start­up OpenAI set the tech­nol­o­gy world ablaze with the debut of ChatGPT, a pro­to­type con­ver­sa­tion­al pro­gram or ​“chat­bot”. It uses a large lan­guage mod­el tuned with machine learn­ing tech­niques to pro­vide answers on a vast vari­ety of sub­jects drawn from books and the World Wide Web, includ­ing Reddit and Wikipedia. Many users and com­men­ta­tors won­dered if its detailed and seem­ing­ly well-​reasoned respons­es could be used in place of human-​written con­tent such as aca­d­e­m­ic essays and expla­na­tions of unfa­mil­iar top­ics. Others noticed that it author­i­ta­tive­ly mixed in fac­tu­al­ly incor­rect infor­ma­tion that might slip past non-​experts, and won­dered if that might be fixed like any oth­er soft­ware ​“bug.”\nThe fun­da­men­tal prob­lem is that an ​“arti­fi­cial intel­li­gence” like ChatGPT is uncon­cerned with the out­side con­se­quences of its use. Unlike humans, it can­not hold its own life as a stan­dard of val­ue. It does not remain ​“alive” through self-​sustaining and self-​generated action. It does not have to be any more or less ratio­nal than its pro­gram­ming to con­tin­ue its exis­tence, not that it ​“cares” about that since it has all the life of an elec­tri­cal switchboard.\nAI can’t know to respect real­i­ty, rea­son, and rights because it has no exis­ten­tial con­nec­tion to those con­cepts. It can only fake it, and it can fail with­out remorse or con­se­quence at any point. In short, ​“arti­fi­cial intel­li­gence” is a red her­ring. Let me know when we’re work­ing on actu­al ethics. Tell me when you can teach a com­put­er (or a human!) pride and shame and every­thing in between."
