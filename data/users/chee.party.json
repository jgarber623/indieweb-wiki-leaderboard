I took a gamble and banged on the flusher and it came up and overflowed all over the bathroom. i placed one square of kitchen paper on the pool of poop and watched as it became soaked, and sunk to the bottom, making no discernible difference. I resorted to using one of our beautiful white towels. I couldn’t find a plunger, and initially i tried making a difference with the toilet brush but it did nothing. Then i felt i needed to check if the pipe was clogged and i pushed my bare hand into the toilet and checked, nothing. I scrubbed up and went looking for a plunger. I found the head of a plunger, but no handle, in the laundry area out the back of the kitchen. I pushed two fingers into the head of the plunger and went into the water sideways down to the bottom, placed my new plunger extension over the hole and plunged once, twice release. once, twice, release. once, twice, and now the water starts to drain. i scrubbed up thoroughly, cleaned the bathroom, brought the towel to the washing machine and scrubbed up thoroughly again and then i went to work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Someone e-mailed me a feature request for my firefox <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/javascript/\">javascript</a> addon. I added the feature and e-mailed them back. Felt very olden days, very cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ll make a chili tonight, it’ll be good. i guess maybe it’s bolognese. i don’t know. what’s the difference between chili and bolognese? maybe it’s just whether you use carrot or bell pepper.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"thursday\"><a href=\"https://chee.party/#thursday\">thursday </a></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>sofia made tasty fried eggy 🥚 breakfast. fried eggs in corn tortillas. she brought avocados and ketchup but i had already dealt with the egg by the time that arrived.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"friday\"><a href=\"https://chee.party/#friday\">friday</a></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>normal day</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"saturday\"><a href=\"https://chee.party/#saturday\">Saturday</a></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>a <em>lot</em> more to write about in my forthcoming post about teotihuacan. obsidian circles. spent too much money. on the way home we took to the hotel el sueño quetzalcóatl, were walking home but spent all night. beautiful there. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>(so much to say about all this. lost my pen, man made me a new one with stick and fire. went through a hole that led under the stairs</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"domingo\"><a href=\"https://chee.party/#domingo\">domingo</a></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>animal sounds in the middle of the night. dogs saw </p>\n\n\n\n<p>woken up there at 5am by this sine tone ringing, so loud, couldn’t make it quiet.   composition of ordinary things that together are so large. so much more to say. have charcoal notes. we went back to the pyramids. combis, cash, garden, michelady, elotes,</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\">\n\n\n\n<p>weekend was huge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>xo</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>",

We tried a noodle place, but the food looked dry.\n\n\n\nWe went into another noodle place and sat down, but it smelt funny and looked like a barber shop and the waiter was came on with a real grump so we left and went to a diner and ate delicious club sandwiches and corn soup. She had a slice of cake because she isthe birthday girl. Afterwards I walked home, I’ve done that walk before and this time I took some detours and found a mall and some other stuff.\n\n\n\ndid some work. now i’m going to pat some patties into existence and smoke a little weed out of a carrot and play tony hawks pro skater\n\n\n\nburger king emailed everyone a blank e-mail\n\n\n\ntuesday\n\n\n\nhello!\n\n\n\nmade some hamburguesas, had a really weird fucking dream about being on a boat and later aliens. i was on this boat that got stuck in a big river, so i went for a walk with some people around the town. i got separated from them and got lost and found myself in the basement of a tall cylindrical building. i was talking to somebody i knew, but then these angry kids came in and they started chasing me out of the basement and up the cylindrical staircase. there was a fast furious one with hot pans. i threw another one of the kids at the pans and ran up the spiral staircase 1 floor past the door and out the window. outside i met a police wearing a black outfit with a flame painted on it, and i asked him “can anything be done about the 1943 fire here?” and he said “no” and i walked away. but then a few steps later i noticed he was right beside me, and he asked “what do you mean by ‘be done’?” and i noticed for the first time that he had a perfectly round, perfectly smooth, pitch black head. it was shiny, like glass. i was transported out of my body and shown a historical montage of lots of greenish-grey little aliens with flat wrinkly heads and large black eyes arriving to earth in individual spaceships (¿spacecars?). the policeman was narrating explaining that The 1943 Pact had allowed these aliens to come and work on earth. but the pact was secret and no social programs were installed to help the workers they replaced, and so the workers became furious and that’s how The Fire started. a new video came in with an untrustworthy internet personality explaining something about aliens and PFPs (PFPs are your representation here on earth), then they pressed a button labeled “evil version of me” and got really monstrous and started shouting in my mind “Use this against your PFP, use this against your PFP” over and over and over until i woke up.\n\n\n\nwednesday\n\n\n\nWednesday I woke up at 6am to a clogged, waterlogged toilet. I took a gamble and banged on the flusher and it came up and overflowed all over the bathroom. i placed one square of kitchen paper on the pool of poop and watched as it became soaked, and sunk to the bottom, making no discernible difference. I resorted to using one of our beautiful white towels. I couldn’t find a plunger, and initially i tried making a difference with the toilet brush but it did nothing. Then i felt i needed to check if the pipe was clogged and i pushed my bare hand into the toilet and checked, nothing. I scrubbed up and went looking for a plunger. I found the head of a plunger, but no handle, in the laundry area out the back of the kitchen. I pushed two fingers into the head of the plunger and went into the water sideways down to the bottom, placed my new plunger extension over the hole and plunged once, twice release. once, twice, release. once, twice, and now the water starts to drain. i scrubbed up thoroughly, cleaned the bathroom, brought the towel to the washing machine and scrubbed up thoroughly again and then i went to work.\n\n\n\nSomeone e-mailed me a feature request for my firefox javascript addon. I added the feature and e-mailed them back. Felt very olden days, very cool.\n\n\n\nI’ll make a chili tonight, it’ll be good. i guess maybe it’s bolognese. i don’t know. what’s the difference between chili and bolognese? maybe it’s just whether you use carrot or bell pepper.\n\n\n\nthursday \n\n\n\nsofia made tasty fried eggy 🥚 breakfast. fried eggs in corn tortillas. she brought avocados and ketchup but i had already dealt with the egg by the time that arrived.\n\n\n\nfriday\n\n\n\nnormal day\n\n\n\nSaturday\n\n\n\na lot more to write about in my forthcoming post about teotihuacan. obsidian circles. spent too much money. on the way home we took to the hotel el sueño quetzalcóatl, were walking home but spent all night. beautiful there. \n\n\n\n(so much to say about all this. lost my pen, man made me a new one with stick and fire. went through a hole that led under the stairs\n\n\n\ndomingo\n\n\n\nanimal sounds in the middle of the night. dogs saw \n\n\n\nwoken up there at 5am by this sine tone ringing, so loud, couldn’t make it quiet.   composition of ordinary things that together are so large. so much more to say. have charcoal notes. we went back to the pyramids. combis, cash, garden, michelady, elotes,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nweekend was huge.\n\n\n\nxo"
