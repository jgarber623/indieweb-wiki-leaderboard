I was planning on eating cheese in the bath like on new years, but instead I spent the day shopping for a new espresso machine and then getting the espresso machine and then looking at the espresso machine. I was meant to go out on Tuesday night but I have some really bad gender-dysphoria-going-on-agoraphobia type thing at the moment that has kept me safe and quiet in my home. My home has no bubble bath in it. It has coffee. The problem with the new espresso machine is it’s very good, and now I need a new grinder. It’s funny how these kinds thing work. Tier one, you pay a little but you have to do everything yourself. Tier two, you pay a bunch more money but everything is done for you. Tier three, you pay an extremely foolish amount of money and you get to do everything yourself. There is a pair of zuchinis on my kitchen table and I don’t know what to do about it. At work I published a post on the internal blogging platform. I mentioned it had been my birthday and explained that everybody who didn’t wish me a happy birthday is now on a list. Afterwards people DM’d me on various communication systems wishing me a happy birthday. Do they think that gets them taken off the list? The list is immutable. There is no way off the list. I have a headache. I’m probably dehydrated. I’ve probably never wished any of them a happy birthday. Not sure if the headache is getting worse or if it’s more noticeable now that I’m trying to write. Maybe it’s a lack of oxygen. That’s not just for coffee, that tier system. Other things too. Many hobbies and crafts are like that, aren’t they? I’d crack open a window but it sure is cold in here. There isn’t really a list for people who didn’t wish me a happy birthday. Maybe I could go for a walk. OK, I’ll turn the heating on and crack open a window. I ate two eggs today. Two eggs ought to be enough for anyone. I guess it’s 6pm and two eggs isn’t enough for anyone. OK. I guess I’ll spiralize them, the courgettes, eat them with cheese. </p>",

Moments about a point. </p>\n<p> It’s my birthday next week. I’ll be taking some time off to eat cheese in the bath. This is how I celebrate all events in 2023. New Year’s – cheddar in the bath. Birthday – cheddar in the bath. Vernal equinox – ossau iraty in the shower. Easter – soak inside hot burrata for 3 days and emerge reborn. May day – brebis. </p>\n<p> There was an event on Friday evening that I was meant to be attending with dearest Duckie and Pixie, but it was cancelled at the last minute. Luckily I had a backup plan which was just as enjoyable: doing literally nothing at all. 😌 </p>\n<p> On Saturday I tidied my entire apartment. Floors have been steamed. Walls have been scrubbed. There is so much space. It’s fun to tidy the apartment and then rotate the sofa. It’s like moving home. While I was tidying I kept breaking my own heart, telling myself things I know not to true. I mean, it is true that I have said no to a wonderful life. The only problem is it would not have been my life. </p>\n<p> I’ll pop off to the market now to see if they have any paneer.

                "value": "The week\n\n By the end of the week I’d got sick and had to take a couple days off. Moments about a point. \n It’s my birthday next week. I’ll be taking some time off to eat cheese in the bath. This is how I celebrate all events in 2023. New Year’s – cheddar in the bath. Birthday – cheddar in the bath. Vernal equinox – ossau iraty in the shower. Easter – soak inside hot burrata for 3 days and emerge reborn. May day – brebis. \n There was an event on Friday evening that I was meant to be attending with dearest Duckie and Pixie, but it was cancelled at the last minute. Luckily I had a backup plan which was just as enjoyable: doing literally nothing at all. 😌 \n On Saturday I tidied my entire apartment. Floors have been steamed. Walls have been scrubbed. There is so much space. It’s fun to tidy the apartment and then rotate the sofa. It’s like moving home. While I was tidying I kept breaking my own heart, telling myself things I know not to true. I mean, it is true that I have said no to a wonderful life. The only problem is it would not have been my life. \n I’ll pop off to the market now to see if they have any paneer. If not, i’ll try my luck with lemon juice and a bucket of milk. \n\n\n\nQuestions\n\n\nWhat is the most springtime of the cheeses?\n\n\n\n\nTips\n\n\nWith a clean rabbit and a tidy home you can do anything.\nIf you think of something that makes you laugh, try adding it as a reminder so one day you wake up to a notification like:\n\n\n DUE TODAY yahoo stands for yet another hoo \n\n\nListening to highly melodic music you know well through distortion and delay and ring modulators feels very good.

You can C-x C-e to send the last expression to the repl to be evaluated, C-c C-c to send the current defun. It’s really powerful and cool! It makes Common Lisp almost as fun to write as emacs lisp3! Check out the manual when you are ready to know more. \n The quicklisp contrib here lets you load systems into the repl by pressing , then typing ql then hitting enter and typing the name of the package. It’ll show you all the packages it knows about, even ones you haven’t installed. It’s really fast, wow. \n\n\n\nVisual Studio Code\n\n I’ve heard good things4 about ALIVE, which is a SLIME-like for Visual Studio Code. \n You aready have Quicklisp installed so you can run this to get all the dependencies: \n\n\nsbcl --eval '(ql:quickload \"bordeaux-threads\")' \\\n     --eval '(ql:quickload \"usocket\")' \\\n     --eval '(ql:quickload \"cl-json\")' \\\n     --eval '(ql:quickload \"flexi-streams\")' \\\n     --quit\n\n\n Then you can install the extension from within Visual Studio Code and you should be good to go! There’s a LOT of information about using Alive on the Common Lisp cookbook page about it. \n If you run into any trouble, check ALIVE’s overview on the Visual Studio Marketplace. \n\n\n\n\n4. Start writing some damn lisp!!!!\n\n If you’re looking for a good book to get started, I don’t believe there’s anything better than the gigamonkeys book. I first went through it about 15 years ago and had a great time, though I didn’t understand much of what I was doing back then. I’m just about to go through it again. Join me! \n If you’re knew to lisp altogether, the mini-tutorials on lisp-lang.org will be helpful for you. \n I’d recommend keeping all your source code in \\~/common-lisp/. That folder is automatically picked up by asdf and quicklisp so you’ll be able to more easily define and use your own systems when the time comes. That’s a topic for another blog post. \n\n\n\nResources of interest\n\n Here are some cool things to know about: \n\nPractical Common Lisp\nThe gigamonkeys book mentioned above\nCLOG\nThis is a really cool UI kit for building GUIs with common lisp that can run on computers and phones!\nIncludine\nA library/environment for DSP and composing scores in Lisp. bonkers.\nCLiki\nThe common lisp wiki, full of information\nCommon Lisp Cookbook\nThorough, helpful articles and a lot of good links.\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n1 \n\n Except CHICKEN, of course, because it rules. \n\n\n2 \n\n In the original version of the post, I had a bit here about overriding the slime-words-of-encouragement to remove the one that calls you brother, but then a few hours later the maintainer of SLIME pushed a commit that deletes it! \n I still like some of the ones I added, though: \n\n\n(mapc (apply-partially #'add-to-list 'slime-words-of-encouragement)\n      '(\"Come on, let's go.\"\n        \"Vamos.\"\n        \"A ver.\"\n        \"You'll always find me in the REPL at parties.\"\n        \"OK, let me have it.\"))\n\n\n It keeps all the originals and adds these few extra silly ones. \n\n\n3 \n\n Not quite, though. Nothing is as fun to write as emacs lisp. Emacs lisp is literally the best programming language in the world. \n The example of how I’ve configured SLIME is trimmed down for the post. The full version has a lot of extra fancy stuff. You can see here: https://chee.party/notebook/docfiles/emacs/setup.html \n\n\n4 \n\n The “good things” are that it: \n\nexists\nworks"
