This is a lie. There are NONE presently, anywhere, as analysis of the #SARSCoVID2 is still ongoing. Just because the genome has already been published doesn't mean it is fully understood. At some point there will be something available to test and that will take some months to ensure no dangerous side-effects (let's cure not kill, please) so at best it will be the end of year before a safe vaccination.By which time you'll probably have already caught it given how little testing is being undertaken in most countries (so allowing spread without knowledge).By the way, 'working from home' should NOT mean working from your preferred cafe. \n\n\t\t\t\t\n   0 shares\n\n\t\t\nIn brief …\n2020-03-04\nChoosing your candidate\nIt does not matter how much you like or prefer one candidate over another if they aren't electable…\n\n\n2020-02-19\nEMF Camp 2020\nThis evening was the first of the three ticket scrambles for this year's EMF camp.…\n\n\n2020-01-31\nDead links\nBecause I'm currently in a redevelopment phase here, moving code between domains and services, I can see from…\n\n\n2020-01-26\nHS2\nHS2 isn't about speed, indeed it's entirely the wrong name: It is about *long distance non stop* services…"
