The rabbit hole is deep and full of surprises that seem to animate the surrounding chaos.</p>\n\n<p>Crypto’s culture is young and vibrant. I’m reminded of the <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/MarkUp/html-test/ncsa/whats-new.html\">early days of the web</a>, when <a href=\"https://www.pcmag.com/news/a-look-back-at-the-earliest-websites\">sites were weird</a> and creators <a href=\"https://www.howtogeek.com/692445/remembering-geocities-the-1990s-precursor-to-social-media/\">built without constraint</a>. Then as now, nobody quite knew which way the industry’s winds blew; they built anyway. Crypto is the center of a new design trend that hearkens back to <a href=\"https://www.spacejam.com/1996/\">Space Jam</a>, bringing its aesthetics into a <a href=\"https://flamingodao.xyz/\">technotronic future</a>. It’s home to <a href=\"https://gaby.mirror.xyz/qvnNJhylZz-w6t4ubZzHfxd5gP17zDAXa6ruwOyO7sc\">new writing</a> and <a href=\"https://startupy.world/\">criticism</a> that feels like the work of whip-smart <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Essay_Concerning_Human_Understanding\">semiotics</a> majors. Like the early web, there’s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1442201621266534402\">lofty rhetoric</a> about crypto’s utopian potential. New <a href=\"https://www.fwb.help/\">social clubs</a> seem as enthusiastic about throwing underground <a href=\"https://gallery.fwb.help/fwb-paris\">raves in Paris</a> as they are with the <a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/friends-with-benefits-pro/\">market value of their tokens</a>.</p>\n\n<p>This exciting emerging culture comes with a giant asterisk. I think <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pinboard\">@pinboard</a> said it best when he described crypto as “<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Pinboard/status/1445934490136690691\">an unregulated casino with a hip bar scene</a>”. He continued: “there’s nothing morally neutral about the criminality at the heart of the endeavor”. Every big-time speculator, punter, grifter, money launderer, and ransomware bandit in the world is hard at work in the casino. No matter how literate the bar scene, it’s the fruit of a poison tree.</p>\n\n<p><em>Just inside the crypto rabbit hole, we find a genuinely new and expressive culture emerging from the grimy bits of unregulated capitalism run amok.</em></p>\n\n<p>Code animates the crypto ecosystem; its more starry-eyed believers claim that <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.02507\">code is all that matters</a>. And, to be sure, there <em>is</em> very interesting code behind crypto. A dozen years ago, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a> introduced the world to a new form of <a href=\"https://cs251.stanford.edu/lectures/lecture5.pdf\">distributed consensus</a>. Half a decade later, <a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/\">Ethereum</a> proved the viability of <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/topics/smart-contracts\">smart contract programming</a>. Since then, <a href=\"https://medium.com/solana-labs/7-innovations-that-make-solana-the-first-web-scale-blockchain-ddc50b1defda\">algorithmic advancements</a> have led to <a href=\"https://solana.com/\">low-cost high-throughput chains</a>. Emerging financial protocols on top of blockchains — <a href=\"https://makerdao.com/en/\">MakerDAO</a>, which creates a dollar-stable asset through <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-10-11/look-out-for-cops-in-the-pump-and-dump\">collateralization</a>; <a href=\"https://uniswap.org/\">Uniswap</a>, an exchange without an order book; and <a href=\"https://compound.finance/\">Compound</a>, a decentralized interest rate market — all have innovative technical and economic underpinnings.</p>\n\n<p>The technical history of the Internet is, in part, the history of the birth, adoption, and stewardship of distributed protocols by its broader community. Blockchains follow in this tradition but also depart radically from it: they are the first protocols to arrive with an asset class attached. Protocols like <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc821\">SMTP</a> and <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2616\">HTTP</a> created immense value for the world but captured little for their inventors; blockchains and the protocols built on top of them upset this balance, allowing inventors to capture <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/04/investing/ethereum-founder-billionaire/index.html\">considerable value</a> for themselves. Historically successful protocols typically see slow early adoption; crypto’s new protocols break this mold by nearly requiring substantial up-front speculation (or wise investment!) in order to achieve escape velocity. As a result, it’s alarmingly easy to launch systems that look indistinguishable from <a href=\"https://www.ic.unicamp.br/~stolfi/bitcoin/2020-12-31-bitcoin-ponzi.html\">Ponzi schemes</a> or multi-level marketing.</p>\n\n<p><em>Midway down the crypto rabbit hole, we find a technically intriguing class of Internet protocols that upend the historical balance of value creation and capture, leading to surprising and problematic new dynamics.</em></p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, healthy economies need productive ends. While <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/crypto-complex-recalls-1920s-stock-market-with-rampant-speculation-manipulation-and-theft-says-left-leaning-think-tank-11633357922\">speculation</a> almost certainly drives crypto’s outsize market cap today, it’s hard to ignore the community’s rapid experimentation. Perhaps crypto will never uncover true sources of value creation; perhaps there are none to be found. Or perhaps the essential ingredients are already in the kitchen. At the heart of every crypto experiment lies the simple <a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/\">abstraction</a> of <a href=\"https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721\">tokens</a>: marks on ledgers maintained by the network. Anyone can wave a “magic wand” and declare the existence of a new token that the world will honor merely by collective agreement. Of course, waving wands alone isn’t enough to create value. Yesterday, we experimented by attaching goofy images of <a href=\"https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks\">punks</a> and <a href=\"https://boredapeyachtclub.com/#/\">apes</a> to our tokens. Today, we’re starting to staple <a href=\"https://t.co/wPxsnGQRpN?amp=1\">metadata with complex structure</a>. Tomorrow, perhaps, we’ll wrap our tokens with increasingly sophisticated code: code that <a href=\"https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/governance/Governor.sol\">grants permissions and access rights</a>, code that defines and enforces <a href=\"https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/finance/PaymentSplitter.sol\">behavior</a>, and code that describes <a href=\"https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC1155/ERC1155.sol\">how to interact</a> with crypto’s new payment rails. There’s an immense design space to explore; it seems too bearish to entirely dismiss its potential.</p>\n\n<p>The collective agreement that makes crypto’s “magic wand” possible at all is, to me, a puzzle. By nature, digital content can be reproduced at zero marginal cost. Why is it that we’ve decided to recreate scarcity in the digital world? Yes, we’ve grappled with digital scarcity in limited domains before. Video games <a href=\"https://fnbr.co/shop\">sell digital items</a>; the appeal is easy to understand. Software <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/activate-windows-c39005d4-95ee-b91e-b399-2820fda32227\">phones home</a> to check its license. Intellectual property itself is a form of manufactured digital scarcity. Yet crypto seems to throw these doors wide open. Perhaps this was inevitable. Perhaps the centuries we’ve spent building societies and economic systems around the unavoidable problem of physical scarcity makes digital scarcity feel natural to us even though it’s unnatural to information itself. Whatever the case, the <a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/\">deluge of capital</a> that floods the crypto markets today practically guarantees that we’ll experiment with manufactured digital scarcity for quite some time to come.</p>\n\n<p><em>Deep down the crypto rabbit hole, we see that while crypto</em> might <em>portend a revolution, at its heart is a simple reassertion of scarcity in the digital realm — an assertion that is by no means a foregone conclusion.</em></p>\n\n<p>Where does crypto go from here? With so many cards — cultural, technical, economic, and regulatory — in the air, it’s impossible to predict its future trajectory. But the technology industry is immensely path dependent. Particularly when buckets of money appear, feedback loops can form whose outcomes seem all but inevitable. Speculators and venture capitalists alike have inundated crypto with cash. Blockchains may become the future only because their story was told, speculated on, invested in, and told some more. Whatever drives us, if society decides to wander further down this road, we should expect to see the same unequal outcomes we see today merely reproduced in the digital realm. Despite the <a href=\"https://www.fwb.help/wip/fractionalized-everything\">utopian rhetoric</a>, economic power always concentrates: crypto may mint new winners, but the tune will stay the same.</p>",

I think @pinboard said it best when he described crypto as “an unregulated casino with a hip bar scene”. He continued: “there’s nothing morally neutral about the criminality at the heart of the endeavor”. Every big-time speculator, punter, grifter, money launderer, and ransomware bandit in the world is hard at work in the casino. No matter how literate the bar scene, it’s the fruit of a poison tree.\n\nJust inside the crypto rabbit hole, we find a genuinely new and expressive culture emerging from the grimy bits of unregulated capitalism run amok.\n\nCode animates the crypto ecosystem; its more starry-eyed believers claim that code is all that matters. And, to be sure, there is very interesting code behind crypto. A dozen years ago, Bitcoin introduced the world to a new form of distributed consensus. Half a decade later, Ethereum proved the viability of smart contract programming. Since then, algorithmic advancements have led to low-cost high-throughput chains. Emerging financial protocols on top of blockchains — MakerDAO, which creates a dollar-stable asset through collateralization; Uniswap, an exchange without an order book; and Compound, a decentralized interest rate market — all have innovative technical and economic underpinnings.\n\nThe technical history of the Internet is, in part, the history of the birth, adoption, and stewardship of distributed protocols by its broader community. Blockchains follow in this tradition but also depart radically from it: they are the first protocols to arrive with an asset class attached. Protocols like SMTP and HTTP created immense value for the world but captured little for their inventors; blockchains and the protocols built on top of them upset this balance, allowing inventors to capture considerable value for themselves. Historically successful protocols typically see slow early adoption; crypto’s new protocols break this mold by nearly requiring substantial up-front speculation (or wise investment!) in order to achieve escape velocity. As a result, it’s alarmingly easy to launch systems that look indistinguishable from Ponzi schemes or multi-level marketing.\n\nMidway down the crypto rabbit hole, we find a technically intriguing class of Internet protocols that upend the historical balance of value creation and capture, leading to surprising and problematic new dynamics.\n\nUltimately, healthy economies need productive ends. While speculation almost certainly drives crypto’s outsize market cap today, it’s hard to ignore the community’s rapid experimentation. Perhaps crypto will never uncover true sources of value creation; perhaps there are none to be found. Or perhaps the essential ingredients are already in the kitchen. At the heart of every crypto experiment lies the simple abstraction of tokens: marks on ledgers maintained by the network. Anyone can wave a “magic wand” and declare the existence of a new token that the world will honor merely by collective agreement. Of course, waving wands alone isn’t enough to create value. Yesterday, we experimented by attaching goofy images of punks and apes to our tokens. Today, we’re starting to staple metadata with complex structure. Tomorrow, perhaps, we’ll wrap our tokens with increasingly sophisticated code: code that grants permissions and access rights, code that defines and enforces behavior, and code that describes how to interact with crypto’s new payment rails. There’s an immense design space to explore; it seems too bearish to entirely dismiss its potential.\n\nThe collective agreement that makes crypto’s “magic wand” possible at all is, to me, a puzzle. By nature, digital content can be reproduced at zero marginal cost. Why is it that we’ve decided to recreate scarcity in the digital world? Yes, we’ve grappled with digital scarcity in limited domains before. Video games sell digital items; the appeal is easy to understand. Software phones home to check its license. Intellectual property itself is a form of manufactured digital scarcity. Yet crypto seems to throw these doors wide open. Perhaps this was inevitable. Perhaps the centuries we’ve spent building societies and economic systems around the unavoidable problem of physical scarcity makes digital scarcity feel natural to us even though it’s unnatural to information itself. Whatever the case, the deluge of capital that floods the crypto markets today practically guarantees that we’ll experiment with manufactured digital scarcity for quite some time to come.\n\nDeep down the crypto rabbit hole, we see that while crypto might portend a revolution, at its heart is a simple reassertion of scarcity in the digital realm — an assertion that is by no means a foregone conclusion.\n\nWhere does crypto go from here? With so many cards — cultural, technical, economic, and regulatory — in the air, it’s impossible to predict its future trajectory. But the technology industry is immensely path dependent. Particularly when buckets of money appear, feedback loops can form whose outcomes seem all but inevitable. Speculators and venture capitalists alike have inundated crypto with cash. Blockchains may become the future only because their story was told, speculated on, invested in, and told some more. Whatever drives us, if society decides to wander further down this road, we should expect to see the same unequal outcomes we see today merely reproduced in the digital realm. Despite the utopian rhetoric, economic power always concentrates: crypto may mint new winners, but the tune will stay the same."

The details of the underlying protocols are not specific to COVID-19 and should provide a foundation for future epidemics.</p>\n\n<p>The current specifications appear to strike a balance between privacy and anonymity and the need to share diagnostic information with arbitrary third parties. In the assumed common case where the mobile device’s owner remains healthy, no identifiable information of any kind is obtainable by any third party, including the operators of back-end data services and the developers of contact tracing applications. (Contact tracing applications can of course explicitly <em>ask</em> for PII and can share this information with data services, but the Apple + Google protocols themselves stay silent on this point.) On the other hand, in the assumed rare case where a mobile device’s owner gets sick, that owner voluntarily shares cryptographic identifiers associated with the specific days when they might have been contagious. With access to these identifiers, owners of mobile devices that were within Bluetooth range of the symptomatic individual can rank the severity of their exposure <em>without</em> the ability to determine the infected individual’s identity. In addition, it is not possible for data service providers to determine which set of users may be at risk; the information necessary to make this determination lives on, and never leaves, the at-risk mobile devices.</p>\n\n<p>Because the Apple + Google partnership does not provide a contact tracing app or a contact tracing data service — and because these are necessary components of an at-scale solution — there are many open questions about how digital contact tracing will work in <em>practice</em>.</p>\n\n<p>For instance: it is unclear who will be allowed to ship applications that use these new protocols.

This led to a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aviel/status/1235589958770950147\">tart reaction</a> from a fellow traveller in the local tech community:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>People need to stop confusing “first US outbreak” with “only fucking place we are testing because we said fuck waiting for those test kits”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There are several things to tease apart here.</p>\n\n<p>First: yes, Seattle has a better grasp on its situation than probably any other region in the US because <a href=\"https://bedford.io/team/\">smart researchers in our area</a> effectively <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ericuman/status/1234987363643691009\">worked around the CDC</a>.

Based on news reports, it sounds like it’s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NNUBonnie/status/1235663306246860800\">vastly too little</a>. But it’s also not zero.</p>\n\n<p>Third: we have more confirmed COVID-19 deaths in Washington State than anywhere else.

(It also won’t be surprising if a major metro, like New York or Houston, spikes beyond us sooner rather than later.)</p>\n\n<p>Finally: at least one Twitter reply described <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ScottGottliebMD/status/1235568500774768640\">Gottlieb’s thread</a> as “<a href=\"https://twitter.com/aviel/status/1235595472019943424\">extremely dangerous</a>”. I suspect we read it quite differently. I read it as an argument that Seattle should seek assistance from the federal government, and that the federal government should tie such assistance to the enactment of even sharper measures to curtail the spread of the disease. Gottlieb appears to argue that Seattle should go first because, by luck of the draw, all eyes are on us. This all seems sensible to me and I generally agree with it. On the other hand, if Gottlieb intended to suggest that the federal government should seize control of public health response in the Seattle region, or that Seattle is the only region for which measures must be taken… well, no, I wouldn’t agree with that at all.</p>",
                "value": "I made the mistake of saying something non-snarky about COVID-19 on Twitter this morning:\n\n\n  Collective action is hard. It’s Seattle’s moment to decide the path ahead.\n\n\nThis seems straightforward: our behavior, right now, can meaningfully alter outcomes in the Seattle metropolitan region. I’m impressed with the measures King County public health has taken so far, including yesterday’s request that all employees who can work from home should work from home. I was happy to see Microsoft and others in the tech community quickly follow suit.\n\nMy statement also came with a retweet of Scott Gottlieb arguing that we need to go further.
