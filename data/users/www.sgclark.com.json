We’re all adults here – we all have our own jobs and lives.  I’d much rather be told early on that it is not a fit, so we can all move on.  Dragging the process out by having useless additional meetings, or ghosting candidates with no explaination or update is just unprofessional and in poor form."

class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>To set the record straight, I [Danielle Reyna] did call (U.S. Soccer sporting director) Earnie Stewart on December 11, just after the news broke that Gregg had made negative statements about my son Gio at a leadership conference, I have known Earnie for years and consider him to be a close friend. I wanted to let him know that I was absolutely outraged and devasted that Gio had been put in such a terrible position, and that I felt very personally betrayed by the actions of someone my family had considered a friend for decades. As part of that conversation, I told Earnie that I thought it was especially unfair that Gio, who had apologized for acting immaturely about his playing time, was still being dragged through the mud when Gregg had asked for and received forgiveness for doing something so much worse at the same age. Without going into detail, the statements from yesterday significantly minimize the abuse on the night in question. Rosalind Berhalter was my roommate, teammate and best friend, and I supported her through the trauma that followed. It took a long time for me to forgive and accept Gregg afterward, but I worked hard to give him grace, and ultimately made both of them and their kids a huge part of my family’s life. I would have wanted and expected him to give the same grace to Gio. This is why the current situation is so very hurtful and hard.  At the time I called Earnie, many people were trashing Gio on social media due to Gregg’s comments, and I didn’t know when or if this would stop. I just wanted Earnie to help make sure that there would be no further unwarranted attacks on my son. I thought our conversation would remain in confidence, and it didn’t occur to me at the time that anything I said could lead to an investigation. I’m not criticizing Earnie here. “I very much commend the recent efforts by U.S. Soccer to address abuse of women players, and I understand now he had an obligation to investigate what I shared. But I want to be very clear that I did not ask for Gregg to be fired, I did not make any threats, and I don’t know anything about any blackmail attempts, nor have I ever had any discussions about anyone else on Gregg’s staff — I don’t know any of the other coaches. I did not communicate with anyone in U.S. Soccer about this matter before December 11, and no one else in my family has made any statements to U.S. Soccer regarding Gregg’s past at all.  I’m sorry that this information became public, and I regret that I played a role in something that could reopen wounds from the past.</p>\n<cite>The Athletic (paywall)</cite>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, the USMNT did not have any chance of seriously competing for this year’s World Cup in Qatar.  It was a ‘we’re happy to be here’ appearance and anything beyond making the knockout stage was playing with house money (being that the USMNT didn’t even qualify in 2018).  Would playing Gio Reyna have changed the USMNT’s outcome? I’m guessing probably not. The Netherlands team the US lost to was an exceptionally well coached team that was playing chess compared to Berhalter’s checkers strategy.  Playing Gio <em>may</em> have made the matches in the knockout stage a little easier however I’m not convinced he would have been a difference maker vs the Netherlands, much less the next round opponent Argentina should we have advanced.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The way Berhalter handled the Gio Reyna situation was a failure of leadership to not clearly and truthfully communicate the reasons for his decisions to the player, the press and by proxy, the fans of the USMNT team.  I can also relate to Mrs. Reyna’s perception on how Coach Berhalter’s negative statements about Gio in the conference she noted above were unfair, damaging, and, frankly, an immature way of handling the situation.  Reading between the lines, it seems that the long and deep relationship that the Reyna and Berhalter families had probably gave Gio and his parents the perception that he was going to get ample playing time in the World Cup and when things didn’t go exactly to Gio’s liking, there was likely a sense of disappointment that clearly went south quickly. The way Gio reacted was immature, yet even though he has been playing soccer at some of the highest levels in the world, let’s remember that <em>he’s still all of 20 years old</em>. Suburban soccer mom’s can be a nasty bunch sometimes, and even when you’re the Head Coach of the freaking US Men’s National Team, you can be taken to the woodshed by a mom who’s pissed her son did not play as much as they would have liked.</p>",

I pondered this for a second and wondered if I was expecting anything of any significance and thought nothing much of it at the time.  Later, when I was free, she brought the box down to the basement where my office/den/”man-cave” is.  And again, I was still befuddled as to what this could be.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, as visitors to this site may know, I have a hobby of creating device/computer <a href=\"https://www.sgclark.com/wallpapers\">Desktop Wallpapers</a>  – something that started several years ago when I thought it would be cool to design backgrounds for <a href=\"https://www.sgclark.com/wallpapers/epl\">English Premier League</a> teams that matched their kit/jersey designs. Since then, I regularly get ‘special requests’ from people all across the internet that I do my best to fulfill.  And on each of the Wallpaper pages on my site, I include some links to give people the opportunity to donate to me as a recognition of the time and effort it takes to make these items.  One of the links I include is to my <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/7H7D2F4WEKR4?ref_=wl_share\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Amazon Wish List</a>.  And on my Wishlist, one of the items that I had innocently added was the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06Y2G2YP5/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Webaround Big Shot</a>, a large green screen background that you can attach to the back of your desk chair in order to have a cleaner display of the background when on a Zoom call.  So instead of having my basement showing behind me when on said Zoom call, I could have something like <a href=\"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/star-wars-backgrounds-23.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Coruscant</a> (Star Wars) or <a href=\"https://cboardinggroup.medium.com/31-zoom-backgrounds-your-coworkers-will-be-drooling-over-e2362f5918a9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">hipster lofts or the skyline of NYC</a>.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of all the items on my Wishlist, this was the item that some anonymous person took the time, money and effort to order for me as a gift.  I am assuming it is a gift from one of the many ‘regulars’ that solicit Wallpapers from me however I am not at all sure to be honest, as Amazon does not reveal who purchases things from your Wishlist.  What I do know is that this person could easily have chosen from a long list of other items on my Wishlist that were far cheaper than what this item cost.  I’m somewhat fascinated and intrigued as to why they chose this item compared to the others on my list.  No matter, the generosity is noted!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, whoever the individual is out there on the Internet who purchased this wonderful Webaround Big Shot green screen background that mounts on the back of my desk chair – I would like to send to you a hearty THANK YOU and a note that your gift is recognized and appreciated!!  </p>",

Wooly Mammoth.  Yeah, <em>those</em> Wooly Mammoths from pre-historic days.  A group of students from the University of Virginia <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2022/06/14/1104158719/woolly-mammoth-tusk-koyukuk-river-alaska\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">were on a research trip to Alaska</a> and they saw this while traveling down the Koyukuk River:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“We’re on this trip to basically to study the arctic, the idea of the arctic as a sanctuary,” said Epstein. “We did a river float trip, as part of what we’re doing and the mammoth tusk was pointed out to us. It’s amazing! During the time of the last glaciation and timing of the <a href=\"https://home.nps.gov/bela/learn/historyculture/woolly-mammoth-page-2.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bering Land Bridge</a>, or what we call the mammoth steppe, that area was populated by lots of grazing animals, the mammoth being one of them.

I have been diligent about checking out reviews and listening to critics before diving into new TV shows because I already am ‘in deep’ on too many TV shows.  Whenever I engaged in any of the many ‘prestige’ television shows that are out there, a key criteria is the legitimacy and believability of the storyline relative to the premise of the show.  And what I mean by this is the following: if, for example, a show is based on a fantasy premise, then it needs to effectively create the world-view that you are entering and set the proper context and boundaries in which the fantasy can operate within before it becomes truly unbelievable to the viewer.  Similarly with ‘real world’ stories, the same thing applies.

It is such a major gap in the show.  Maybe the show-runners did not feel that they could effectively juggle three major story arch’s (1996 crash site, the 1996 families trying to find their kids, and the survivors living ‘today’ in 2021) and while I can appreciate that, you don’t need to look too much further than ‘Game of Thrones’ to see how a show has deftly threaded a similar needle.  They could have, for example, dedicated one ‘stand alone’ episode within the season to the families at home in NJ and how they were coping and trying to solve finding the plane.  They could have extended the season from 10 to 12 episodes to accommodate the same.

                "value": "Over the course of the past two years, as we have all been home because of the pandemic, I’ve been consuming a lot of movies and TV.  I have been diligent about checking out reviews and listening to critics before diving into new TV shows because I already am ‘in deep’ on too many TV shows.  Whenever I engaged in any of the many ‘prestige’ television shows that are out there, a key criteria is the legitimacy and believability of the storyline relative to the premise of the show.  And what I mean by this is the following: if, for example, a show is based on a fantasy premise, then it needs to effectively create the world-view that you are entering and set the proper context and boundaries in which the fantasy can operate within before it becomes truly unbelievable to the viewer.  Similarly with ‘real world’ stories, the same thing applies. The story needs to be rooted in reality and clearly be cognizant of the timeframe and context in which it is set.\n\n\n\nOne show I have recently been watching is “Yellowjackets” on Showtime.
