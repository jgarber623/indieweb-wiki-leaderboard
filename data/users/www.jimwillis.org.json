My first very satisfying repair.</p>\n<p>By the time I’d driven the car home from Philadelphia, the speedometer cable snapped, so I had to replace it. This was my first “job” on the vanagon. It was harder than I thought it was going to be, but I did it and it was great way to dip my toe into the vanagon repairs. That fact that it was successful also helped to keep me motivated on subsequent repairs. $25</p>\n<p>Also, trying to be a responsible dad, I performed a few safety-related upgrades:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Installed third-brake light from GoWesty: $35</li>\n<li>Installed three point seat belts in rear of van on both passenger and driver sides ($210)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>June 2014</p>\n<p>My fuel pump was whining and it was really annoying so I put in a new fuel filter in front of it. It didn’t solve the problem. I suspected the tank was just gummed up but none of the mechanics I spoke with thought it was a big deal. $16</p>\n<p>Also, at this point I upgraded the stock radio and front speakers. I don’t have the costs on this but really need to document the process because I kept the old speaker grills on the doors and a lot of folks have commented to me how they like that. I will write that up someday soon. Still, as this wasn’t a needed repair to keep the van on the road I don’t think the cost information here is critical.</p>\n<p>July 2014</p>\n<p>My van was having a tough time starting every once in a while. It seemed kind of random. I called <a href=\"https://www.vanagain.com/\">Ken Wilford at Vanagain</a> and explained what was going on. He suggested a temp2 sensor for $18 and coached me through installing it via email. Ken is truly one of the great people of the Vanagon community and I love how much he encourages and inspires owners to maintain their Vanagons on their own.</p>\n<p>Also at this time, I <a href=\"https://www.thesamba.com/vw/forum/viewtopic.php?t=603342\">cleaned all of the grounds</a>. This didn’t cost anything and didn’t do anything as far as I could tell, but it seems like a Vanagon owner’s right of passage and it helped me learn a lot about the van’s electrical system.</p>\n<p>March 2015</p>\n<p>I went out to start the Vanagon up after it sat for a lot of the winter and notice I smelled gas. A fuel line connected to one of the fuel injectors had developed a small crack. These were not the original fuel lines and they’d been inspected before we picked up the van so, you really want to keep an eye on these and change them out if they are more than a few years old. I replaced all of the fuel lines on the van and fuel injector seals $70. This is a GREAT way to learn about the fuel delivery system on the Vanagon and is a very easy job to do.</p>\n<p>March 2015</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.alltogetheroutthere.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/vanagon-sewfine-upholstry-upgrade.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-1230\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-1230 jetpack-lazy-image\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.alltogetheroutthere.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/vanagon-sewfine-upholstry-upgrade-1024x768.jpg?resize=670%2C503\" alt=\"A purely cosmetic job but super satisfying-- replacing the torn up corduroy with new fabric from Sewfine.\" width=\"670\" height=\"503\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" data-lazy-srcset=\"https://www.alltogetheroutthere.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/vanagon-sewfine-upholstry-upgrade-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.alltogetheroutthere.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/vanagon-sewfine-upholstry-upgrade-640x480.jpg 640w, https://www.alltogetheroutthere.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/vanagon-sewfine-upholstry-upgrade-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.alltogetheroutthere.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/vanagon-sewfine-upholstry-upgrade-970x728.jpg 970w, https://www.alltogetheroutthere.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/vanagon-sewfine-upholstry-upgrade.jpg 1200w\" data-lazy-sizes=\"(max-width: 970px) 100vw, 970px\" data-lazy-src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.alltogetheroutthere.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/vanagon-sewfine-upholstry-upgrade-1024x768.jpg?resize=670%2C503&amp;is-pending-load=1\" srcset=\"data:image/gif;base64, https://www.jimwillis.org/R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\"><noscript><img data-lazy-fallback=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-1230\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.alltogetheroutthere.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/vanagon-sewfine-upholstry-upgrade-1024x768.jpg?resize=670%2C503\" sizes=\"(max-width: 970px) 100vw, 970px\" srcset=\"https://www.alltogetheroutthere.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/vanagon-sewfine-upholstry-upgrade-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.alltogetheroutthere.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/vanagon-sewfine-upholstry-upgrade-640x480.jpg 640w, https://www.alltogetheroutthere.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/vanagon-sewfine-upholstry-upgrade-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.alltogetheroutthere.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/vanagon-sewfine-upholstry-upgrade-970x728.jpg 970w, https://www.alltogetheroutthere.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/vanagon-sewfine-upholstry-upgrade.jpg 1200w\" alt=\"A purely cosmetic job but super satisfying-- replacing the torn up corduroy with new fabric from Sewfine.\" width=\"670\" height=\"503\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></noscript></a></p>\n<p>Our corduroy upholstery was shot.

                "value": "I’ve had this Vanagon for 8 years. As best I can tell from the paperwork, before I bought the van it spent several years in a storage facility in Eastern Shore, Maryland. Given that it had zero rust anywhere on it I’d presume the storage facility was climate controlled or at least very dry and not exposed to salt/marine air.\nPlease note that this is a Weekender. It does not have the sink and stove. Instead it has an additional seat and table. I had a camper with the sink/stove prior to this and never used it. The weekender is a better configuration for our family and I spent a long time looking for one in this condition.\nHere’s a timeline of the work I’ve done to it.\nApril, 2014\n This guy, Kevin Mayer who I found on Roadhaus, checked out the Vanagon before I purchased it and then did a bunch of work on it before we took it home.  This guy, Kevin Mayer who I found on Roadhaus, checked out the Vanagon before I purchased it and then did a bunch of work on it before we took it home. \nThis guy, Kevin Mayer from Mayer’s Garage in Philadelphia (HIGHLY RECOMMEND!) who I found on Roadhaus, checked out the Vanagon before I purchased it from a private seller and then did a bunch of work on it before we took it home.\n\nCooling system flush\nBrake fluid flush\nNew break pads and resurface front rotors, new rear brake shoes/rear cylinders\noil change\nrepair speedometer (sent to outside shop, $120)\nshifter pivot/adjust shifter\n\nThese pre-delivery repair/maintenance costs totaled: $864\nIn addition to these maintenance/repair issues, we also had some cosmetic work done that was pretty expensive but it was worth it in the long run as we had new window seals installed all around and larger GoWesty wheels+tires installed. Neither of these were required repairs/maintenance but I’m glad we had that work done by a good mechanic.\nTotal “optional/cosmetic” costs: $1,800\nApril 2014.\n \n The Vanagon was only home for a week before I had to tackle my first job: speedometer cable replacement.  The Vanagon was only home for a week before I had to tackle my first job: speedometer cable replacement. \nThe Vanagon was only home for a week before I had to tackle my first job: speedometer cable replacement. My first very satisfying repair.\nBy the time I’d driven the car home from Philadelphia, the speedometer cable snapped, so I had to replace it. This was my first “job” on the vanagon. It was harder than I thought it was going to be, but I did it and it was great way to dip my toe into the vanagon repairs. That fact that it was successful also helped to keep me motivated on subsequent repairs. $25\nAlso, trying to be a responsible dad, I performed a few safety-related upgrades:\n\nInstalled third-brake light from GoWesty: $35\nInstalled three point seat belts in rear of van on both passenger and driver sides ($210)\n\nJune 2014\nMy fuel pump was whining and it was really annoying so I put in a new fuel filter in front of it. It didn’t solve the problem. I suspected the tank was just gummed up but none of the mechanics I spoke with thought it was a big deal. $16\nAlso, at this point I upgraded the stock radio and front speakers. I don’t have the costs on this but really need to document the process because I kept the old speaker grills on the doors and a lot of folks have commented to me how they like that. I will write that up someday soon. Still, as this wasn’t a needed repair to keep the van on the road I don’t think the cost information here is critical.\nJuly 2014\nMy van was having a tough time starting every once in a while. It seemed kind of random. I called Ken Wilford at Vanagain and explained what was going on. He suggested a temp2 sensor for $18 and coached me through installing it via email. Ken is truly one of the great people of the Vanagon community and I love how much he encourages and inspires owners to maintain their Vanagons on their own.\nAlso at this time, I cleaned all of the grounds. This didn’t cost anything and didn’t do anything as far as I could tell, but it seems like a Vanagon owner’s right of passage and it helped me learn a lot about the van’s electrical system.\nMarch 2015\nI went out to start the Vanagon up after it sat for a lot of the winter and notice I smelled gas. A fuel line connected to one of the fuel injectors had developed a small crack. These were not the original fuel lines and they’d been inspected before we picked up the van so, you really want to keep an eye on these and change them out if they are more than a few years old. I replaced all of the fuel lines on the van and fuel injector seals $70. This is a GREAT way to learn about the fuel delivery system on the Vanagon and is a very easy job to do.\nMarch 2015\n A purely cosmetic job but super satisfying-- replacing the torn up corduroy with new fabric from Sewfine.  A purely cosmetic job but super satisfying-- replacing the torn up corduroy with new fabric from Sewfine. \nOur corduroy upholstery was shot. It didn’t keep us from using the van but over the winter I convinced myself that it would be worth spending the money on good fabric from Sewfine and doing the job myself. I  The van looks awesome now. Thanks Sewfine! Labor + Materials: $900\n Here’s the “after” shot. Really happy with how this came out.\n Here's the \"after\" shot. Really happy with how this came out.  Here's the \"after\" shot. Really happy with how this came out. \n \nApril 2015\nTired of the whining fuel pump, I tried blowing some compressed air into the fuel tank to clear out whatever was clogging it and installing a new fuel pump ($200 for pump and parts). This had limited effect and frankly the original fuel pump was quieter than the replacement.\nMay 2016\nThe engine sounded weird and was losing power. I replaced the plugs, wires and distributor cap ($100). Fixed! And so much more power! This seemed like a big job but doing it step by step made it easy and I really learned a lot about the vanagon doing this.\nJune 2015\nReplace the three belts (power steering, alternator, AC) on the engine. Super easy to do, and a necessary maintenance item before our long summer road trip. $24.\nJuly 2015\n \n Installing jalousie windows in the Vanagon was purely cosmetic but boy does it make sleeping in the summertime better.
