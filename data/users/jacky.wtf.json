I need to put the instance on a domain I control and never change, with all the risks involved in delegating a subdomain.For a network that compares itself to email and preaches &quot;own your identity&quot; it certainly makes it hard, unless you go straight for the true and pure solution of self-hosting everything. Users need graceful on-ramps."
