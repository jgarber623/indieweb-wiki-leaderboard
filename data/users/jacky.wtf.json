Then Obama happened (with how he responded to Flint, Ferguson, his authorization of the bombing of African countries and Caribbean pillaging despite his campaign for hope). And the new president of YC happened (with still very little change into how funding applications turned into more BIPOC getting funding - maybe begging folks for money who won't give it isn't the answer?). Not only did no change happened to those who needed it the most (and were <em>strongly</em> encouraged to vote for — mind you), we see it <em>getting worse</em> because more \"bad behavior\" has been permitted to occur (as described). I know that you're older than me (I'm 29) and have been in this game longer, but that doesn't discount any of the events and experiences mentioned above and, if anything, gives more reason for radical change to occur (which means stepping away from systems that are explicitly designed and maintained to make things difficult for kinfolk).</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://mastodon.world/@brianonbarrington\">https://mastodon.world/@brianonbarrington</a>, my day job is to work \"in the middle ground\", after leaving the private sector to give people that are actively overlooked in policy and works to give them the resources they need for free at <a href=\"https://codeforamerica.org/\">https://codeforamerica.org/</a>.

                "value": "This is a long post.\r\nhttps://hachyderm.io/@mekkaokereke, I was in that stance that \"maybe if we just put more BIPOC people into places, then things would get better\" years ago. https://todon.eu/@jalcine/109904002950795378 is a small rant on that. Then Obama happened (with how he responded to Flint, Ferguson, his authorization of the bombing of African countries and Caribbean pillaging despite his campaign for hope). And the new president of YC happened (with still very little change into how funding applications turned into more BIPOC getting funding - maybe begging folks for money who won't give it isn't the answer?).
