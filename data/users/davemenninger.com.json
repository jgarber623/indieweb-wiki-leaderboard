One idea in particular was interesting enough to me to make me break my 'no scripting' rule.  <a href=\"https://indiewebcamp.com/Micropub\">Micropub</a> is a standard for creating posts on your own site, using third-party clients.  The idea is that you use IndieAuth to authenticate to your own domain, then your site accepts a POST with form-encoded values and creats a note, article, or whatever, in whatever format you want.  Separating the client implementation from the server implementation has some advantages.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>I'm attempting to use it in a particular way on my site, which means I need to write some code.  I've always wanted to create a linkblog like Andy Baio's at <a href=\"http://waxy.org/links/\">Waxy.org</a>.  I currently use <a href=\"https://buffer.com/\">Buffer</a> to post links and they get posted to Twitter and then to Facebook.  Buffer is really nice, but the big downside is that I don't have a nice archive on my own site of what I've posted.  So I'd like to use Micropub to post links to my own site and then <a href=\"https://indiewebcamp.com/POSSE\">POSSE</a> them elsewhere.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>The steps to accomplish this are several.  First, I need a micropub endpoint here so I can post here from other clients.  That's what I have now.  I've used Jeremy Keith's <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/adactio/8168e6b78da7b16a4644\">PHP code</a> to accept micropub posts and store them to <a href=\"http://davemenninger.com/microposts.json\">a file</a> locally.  I am still figuring out whether storing the posts locally in JSON is the best option.  I thought it would be easier to render from JSON to HTML, but after reading <a href=\"http://www.kevinmarks.com/we-like-indieweb-software.html\">this</a>, I'm not sure.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Once I have that figured out, I may attempt to write some micropub clients.  In order to abandon Buffer, I'll need a Chrome extension and a native Android app.  There are some things out there, but I have some ideas I want to add.</p>",

I don't watch very much TV, especially not TV news.  I don't read the paper or magazines.  For years, I was a my-radio-never-leaves-NPR type of person, but I've recently switched to listening to podcasts and my music collection in the car.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>I'm online almost constantly so I get all my news that way now.  I don't visit \"news\" sites though.  I get almost everything that would be considered \"news\" from two main sources.  First, I subscribe to a lot of people on Twitter.  Again, I don't really follow traditional news outlets, but I follow a few journalists that I like as well as a horde of other people that I know will surface any stories that I'm likely to be interested in.  Because I follow so many people, there is no chance I'll be able to watch every tweet, so the way I use Twitter is two-fold.  First, I dip into the firehose whenever there is something interesting happening in real-time using Tweetdeck, lists, and hashtags.  An example would be the civil unrest in Ferguson or the Cincinnati City Council meetings where an important issue is being decided.  The second way I use Twitter is via an aggregator called <a href=\"http://news.me/\">news.me</a>.  News.me looks at all the links tweeted by everyone you follow and picks out the ones that have been tweeted by the most people, then it sends you a digest every day.  This is my morning paper, essentially.  I have tuned the people I follow in such a way that I know news.me will almost always have just the right stories that I want to read.  Yes it is a bit of an echo chamber, so I try to keep that in mind as I read.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>The second main way I get \"news\" is by subscribing to <a href=\"http://nextdraft.com/\">NextDraft</a>.  It's a daily email newsletter by Dave Pell.  The idea is that he sifts through each days news stories and viral content and picks out the best handful of articles on a given topic and a few miscellaneous links of interest.  I like his choices and it cuts way back on reading article after article on a given topic until you find the one that covers the topic well.  He links to current events as well as other quality longform writing and some fun stuff too.  I never read every article in the newsletter and sometimes I don't read any, but it gives me that feeling of being aware of what's going on in the news without being a slave to it.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Apart from Twitter and NextDraft, I still consume a lot of blogs with <a href=\"http://theoldreader.com/\">theoldreader</a> and content on Medium and so forth, but most of that is not for \"news\" purposes.  I listen to a lot of podcasts, including MarketPlace which has a news bent, but I listen to them mostly for pleasure on an arbitrary schedule, not in a timely-manner.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>For me, this is all about being more intentional about the content I consume and the time I spend with my eyes pointed at a screen.  I tend to agree with the assessment that normal daily \"news\" consumption (TV in particular) is not as valuable as it's assumed to be.</p>",
