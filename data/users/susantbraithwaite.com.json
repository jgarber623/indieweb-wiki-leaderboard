However, Monday is the end of my workweek, and I felt rushed to get the post out before the weekend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, after a few weeks of trying it out, I’ve decided to return to my original posting plan on Wednesdays. And yes, I know it’s Thursday today, but I had such a great weekend that I didn’t want to cut into it by thinking about work. 😊</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img
