Check Your Rules!</h3>\n<p><img class=\"right\" src=\"https://townsquare.media/site/65/files/2018/04/computer-crash-go.jpg\" alt=\"computer-crash-go.jpg\">I haven't been able to run Outlook for several months and have been limping along using the <em>painfully awkward</em> <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/how-to-sign-in-to-outlook-on-the-web-763fab4d-0138-4814-b450-37fc286bcb79\">web interface</a> to manage my schedule and email.  Today I <em>finally</em> fixed this issue and can run Outlook again. I thought I'd document my issue here in case anyone else is having this problem. Our internal Help Desk was unable to fix this issue and finally gave up on trying to fix it. </p>\n<p>Here is the issue I was having: I'd fire up Outlook and all seemed ok but after a minute or two  then Outlook would just stop working and crash. No error message, nothing. Just crash. I initially thought it may have been an Outlook profile issue so I deleted and re-created my profile. Nope, problem still happening. Then I thought it might be an issue with the volume of email in my Outlook ost so I cleaned it up. Nope. problem still happening. Then I started thinking about what Outlook might be doing when it first starts up - it initially started up fine but would always crash after a minute or two. This is when I realized it had to the rules. I have a <em>ton</em> of Outlook rules and one of more of them were likely causing Outlook itself to crash.  Since I couldn't change the rules within Outlook (it kept crashing) I had to use the <em>painfully awkward</em> <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/how-to-sign-in-to-outlook-on-the-web-763fab4d-0138-4814-b450-37fc286bcb79\">web interface</a> again.  Clicking on the gear in the top right of the screen enabled me to get access to Outlook settings and my rules.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"https://evdemon.org/file/1ba859b7e90681a3f4a0acdce92e65d9/thumb.png\"><img src=\"https://evdemon.org/file/1ba859b7e90681a3f4a0acdce92e65d9/thumb.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"135\"></a></p>\n<p>Upon reviewing my rules I noticed several of them were referencing a strange GUID value that I didn't recognize. I deleted those rules and restarted Outlook. Problem solved! I never thought I'd be so happy to be able to use Outlook again.</p>\n<p>Hope this helps someone out there someday.</p>\n<h3>You Only Need Three Outlook Mail Sorting Rules</h3>\n<p><img class=\"right\" src=\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71aYQI5JwBL._AC_SL1500_.jpg\" alt=\"71aYQI5JwBL._AC_SL1500_.jpg\">Speaking of Outlook rules, I used to have a ton of them and wasted far too much time setting up a complex series of folders and rules to determine which emails should go into which folders. Now I just have three rules and four Outlook folders. My folders look like this:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"https://evdemon.org/file/8d01f3bfefc45f3e4d170446539ea771\" alt=\"\" width=\"182\" height=\"154\"></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">My three email rules look like this:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"https://evdemon.org/file/265d71bfb6b80b8ece871a95f518d4ad\" alt=\"\" width=\"376\" height=\"76\"></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">and</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"https://evdemon.org/file/a856e564b854c5844dd5b72a60dedf38\" alt=\"\" width=\"417\" height=\"96\"></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">and</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"https://evdemon.org/file/a627ab3f5bee9ae282f9f92ce27a0628\" alt=\"\" width=\"351\" height=\"120\"></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">If I'm CC'd on an email there's no real hurry to get to it. I'll read it later.  All meeting invites and related activity lands in the meeting folder. External email from outside my company is usually lower priority so I'll eventually get to it.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I find this to be a <em>much</em> easier way to manage my email. How do you do it?</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align:left;\">Fixing a Broken Known Config</h3>\n<p><img class=\"left\" src=\"https://photos5.appleinsider.com/archive/gallery/11600-4654-SadMac-l.jpg\" alt=\"11600-4654-SadMac-l.jpg\">Today seems to be the day for computer issues. I decided to start blogging again and wouldn't you know it - my blog stopped working today.   My blog is based upon <a href=\"https://withknown.com/\">Known</a>, a wonderful open source blogging tool with great support for IndieWeb. Anyway, anytime I tried to create a post I received the following error:<br><strong>   Something went wrong.  </strong><strong>Class 'Ramsey\\Uuid\\Uuid' not found</strong><br><br>Well that didn't seem good and I hadn't changed anything so I wasn't sure what happened. I finally decided to simply try re-installing Known and this fixed the issue.

            "value": "Outlook Crashing On Startup? Check Your Rules! computer-crash-go.jpg I haven't been able to run Outlook for several months and have been limping along using the painfully awkward web interface to manage my schedule and email.  Today I finally fixed this issue and can run Outlook again. I thought I'd document my issue here in case anyone else is having this problem. Our internal Help Desk was unable to fix this issue and finally gave up on trying to fix it. Here is the issue I was having: I'd fire up Outlook and all seemed ok but after a minute or two  then Outlook would just stop working and crash. No error message, nothing. Just crash. I initially thought it may have been an Outlook profile issue so I deleted and re-created my profile. Nope, problem still happening. Then I thought it might be an issue with the volume of email in my Outlook ost so I cleaned it up. Nope. problem still happening. Then I started thinking about what Outlook might be doing when it first starts up - it initially started up fine but would always crash after a minute or two. This is when I realized it had to the rules. I have a ton of Outlook rules and one of more of them were likely causing Outlook itself to crash.  Since I couldn't change the rules within Outlook (it kept crashing) I had to use the painfully awkward web interface again.  Clicking on the gear in the top right of the screen enabled me to get access to Outlook settings and my rules.  Upon reviewing my rules I noticed several of them were referencing a strange GUID value that I didn't recognize. I deleted those rules and restarted Outlook. Problem solved! I never thought I'd be so happy to be able to use Outlook again.Hope this helps someone out there someday.You Only Need Three Outlook Mail Sorting Rules 71aYQI5JwBL._AC_SL1500_.jpg Speaking of Outlook rules, I used to have a ton of them and wasted far too much time setting up a complex series of folders and rules to determine which emails should go into which folders. Now I just have three rules and four Outlook folders. My folders look like this:  My three email rules look like this:  and  and  If I'm CC'd on an email there's no real hurry to get to it. I'll read it later.  All meeting invites and related activity lands in the meeting folder. External email from outside my company is usually lower priority so I'll eventually get to it.I find this to be a much easier way to manage my email. How do you do it?Fixing a Broken Known Config 11600-4654-SadMac-l.jpg Today seems to be the day for computer issues.

Howard was one of my favorite characters in the Marvel universe. Howard's creator Steve Gerber was a mad genius and Howard's original comic book series was way ahead of its time, filled with hilarious satire and commentary on the sad state of society.It's too bad that Howard only appears in the What If episode for a few minutes.  Even worse, it's the \"Disney-approved\" version of Howard. In the mid-70s Disney threatened to sue Marvel Comics if they didn't make significant changes to Howard to avoid potential confusion with Donald Duck - the recommended changes appear in the model sheet below. \n  This model sheet summarizes Disney's recommended changes to the original version of Howard. Unfortunately Howard has since been changed to become even uglier. Ugh.\nReal Howard fans know that the version of Howard in the Marvel Universe is actually a clone. The real Howard fled Marvel, was dyed green, and is now in a witness protection program residing in Buffalo, NY under the name \"Leonard\"."
