                "value": "Maya gets it. I mean I don’t even know if I get it as much as Maya does. Glad to\nsit back and learn at this point.\nAfter a year, there’s no need to get high-minded. Maya.land is just fun.\nBut let’s get high-minded anyway.\nIs maya.land a blog? Is it a wiki? Whatever - it’s hypertext through and\nthrough. There’re regular updates, pages devoted to topics (like the goblin\nmanifesto - which also can be blogged to), and\nresponses to things.[1]\nI think Maya has a rare formula where aesthetics and wordsmithing get\nbalanced.\n\nIn the same way that one might ask “how would the Book of Kells have looked if\nColumban monks had had access to neon pigments”, I like to use contemporary\nCSS options as my means toward ends that are a little anachronistic.\n\nI think the pigments do work to say other things that we can’t. Or to be us in this\nhypertext world that we can’t easily pierce.\n\nTo celebrate the inaugural year of maya.land, there is a very precious gift - in the form\nof this carefully annotated blogroll - a very\ngood map of nearby ‘altweb’/‘outerweb’/‘yesterweb’ people!\n Ultimate blogroll spicy pic. \nI harp on about personal directories THEY ARE SAVING US and this lovely little\ncatalog gives me a serious,\nuhh, shall we say… well it gives me the pringles all over. It’s really amusing\nto me that the 88x31 tiles are making such a come back. I mean we’re really\ngetting quite specific with those dimensions.\n\nMaya.land is also a kind of touchstone for the current pragmatic Indieweb stuff.\nWebmentions bring in mentions from Twitter and other websites like mine. RSS\nfeeds are still around.[2] Bit of whostyles\nin there. And a lot of posts get crossposted (manually?) to\nLemmy.\nI think this shows a kind of middle ground of easy-to-reach protocols\nthat should be more achievable to people. It gets you connected to our\nworld of chatter enough that you’re not alone out here - but also gives you\nyour own iceberg to carve.\n\n\n\nLike an iceberg - this\ncomparison was made in Hypertext 2020 - ‘layers of hypertext that\nbecome progressively more personal, or which become more detailed, or perhaps\neven more (or less) ephemeral as you go through the layers.’ ↩︎\n\nMaya: ‘I’m really sick of people complaining that RSS is dead. RSS isn’t\ndead!’ ↩︎"

Also, a pet\nhamster in case Werner Herzog shows up.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"q\">\n<p><strong>Herb Quine:</strong>\nSpeaking of Werner Herzog, name at least one film missing in his filmography and\nhow to fix this grave mistake with the help of a voucher for 53 free time\nmachines minutes to be used for a single travel to a time before October 1995.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"a\">\n<p><strong>Herb Quine:</strong>\nEasy, the film in question would be the missing biopic of Mike Tyson focusing on\nhis time as a scholar of Medieval Media Studies in the field of Carolingian\nReality TV, played by Bruno Schleinstein and filmed entirely in Yiddish. How to\nuse the time machine should be obvious enough.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"q\">\n<p><strong>Herb Quine:</strong>\nMore seriously now, why a pet hamster?</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"a\">\n<p><strong>Herb Quine:</strong>\nPet hamsters are the closest thing to miniature grizzly bears, a fact which is\nof course entirely unrelated to their remarkable characteristics as party\nanimals (the hamsters, not the bears, though they might qualify, too…). The\npurpose of the hamster at Ted’s party is thus twofold: In the unlikely event\nthat a discussion of Xanadu’s future turns into an attempt to establish the\nSeasteading Republic Of Hypertext, someone needs to keep the engines chugging\nalong. And secondly, you need a fluent German speaker to reminisce about Wagner\nwith Werner (coincidentally also the title of the longest running radio show in\nNigeria’s Yiddish enclave).</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"box box-0\" style=\" background:url(/images/blog/quine2.gif)\"><div class=\"box-inside\">\n<div class=\"q\">\n<p><strong>Herb Quine:</strong>\nYou walk down to the shore to buy a new edition of “Learning Perl”, as you do\nevery Thursday. But when you reach the ice cube factory, you suddenly realize\nthat Unicode is pointless. Sure, you can play quite a few nice little language\ngames with all these emojis they keep adding, but the burrow only goes so far.\nAnd then you hit the parking lot of the Consortium’s reserved committee parking\nspaces and tumble head first onto the seat of a convertible. Which makes sense,\nI guess, until you realize that the wonderful weather of the bay area is no\nbueno for rhizomes and others of their ilk. They need constant watering, don’t\nthey?</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"a\">\n<p><strong>Herb Quine:</strong>\nSorry, was there a question?</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"q\">\n<p><strong>Herb Quine:</strong>\nYeah, all right, enough with the rambling. Let’s get down to business. What’s\nyour affiliation with the FBI and are you or have you ever been an agent engaged\nin any work of endeavor related to printables, convertibles, mazes or any\ncombination thereof?</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"a\">\n<p><strong>Herb Quine:</strong>\nI can neither confirm nor deny the existence of the information sought. Also,\nclassical logic is overrated and all these lying Cretan hipsters are not nearly\nas interesting as they think. If you ask me, and you just did, they are just\nlazy bums who came up with this lying-business as an excuse to get out of the\nreal work of building tremendously beautiful walls like real Cretans do. These\nkids nowadays, let me tell you…</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"q\">\n<p><strong>Herb Quine:</strong>\nDat / Hypercore / Beaker sure look very interesting, but aren’t they a technical\nsolution to a problem of the medium? One great aspect of Fraidycat is that it\ndoesn’t care how established or indie your chosen medium is, in a way it feels\nas if Fraidycat is rerouting and connecting existing media to extend and create\nnew media. It doesn’t care if you’re Kylie Jenner or Ted Nelson, it doesn’t\n(much) care about the underlying technology, because it changes the topology of\nthe existing pieces while not denying that centralized sub-parts of the network\nstill exist. Is a more foundational project like Dat / Hypercore / Beaker\northogonal to that idea?</p>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"box box-1\" style=\" background:url(/images/blog/quine.png)\"><div class=\"box-inside\">\n<div class=\"a\">\n<p><strong>Herb Quine:</strong>\nI know I’m mostly answering rhetorical questions at this point, but this is one\nthat I’m really not sure how to answer. I do love the spirit of Dat / Hypercore\n/ Beaker, I am just a bit suspicious of any attempts to revive the good parts of\nthe personal web without paying attention to why it became less important as a\nmedium (the non-app-web, that is), because I would be hesitant to point to\ntechnical reasons. To me, IPFS and SSB in particular often look like solutions\nthat fix all the underlying tech in a very admirable way, without really\nchanging the medium that they are producing or favoring. A decentralized\nFacebook will still result in a medium very much like Facebook, just at a\ndisadvantage because the technical forces can never be fully aligned with the\nforces of the medium.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://www.kickscondor.com/#fn2\" id=\"fnref2\">[2]</a></sup> I do think that Dat / Hypercore / Beaker are not as\nsusceptible in this regard and I really hope that they do not end up emulating\nexisting media too much. But really, I don’t know, what do you think?</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"q\">\n<p><strong>Herb Quine:</strong>\nIs the treasure hunt over? What are we supposed to do now? Wait for National\nTreasure III? IS THIS REALLY IT? What about CGI Youngface and all the hard shell\nkayaks that are still lying around in undiscovered places on the globe? What\nabout annie dark?</p>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"box box-0\" style=\" background:url(/images/blog/quine.jpg)\"><div class=\"box-inside\">\n<div class=\"a\">\n<p><strong>Herb Quine:</strong>\nYeah, I don’t think I’m equipped to answer this one.

After all, how are you supposed to react to such a strange\nand perhaps unexpected offering from a stranger on the internet?

Also, a pet\nhamster in case Werner Herzog shows up.\n\n\nHerb Quine:\nSpeaking of Werner Herzog, name at least one film missing in his filmography and\nhow to fix this grave mistake with the help of a voucher for 53 free time\nmachines minutes to be used for a single travel to a time before October 1995.\n\n\nHerb Quine:\nEasy, the film in question would be the missing biopic of Mike Tyson focusing on\nhis time as a scholar of Medieval Media Studies in the field of Carolingian\nReality TV, played by Bruno Schleinstein and filmed entirely in Yiddish. How to\nuse the time machine should be obvious enough.\n\n\nHerb Quine:\nMore seriously now, why a pet hamster?\n\n\nHerb Quine:\nPet hamsters are the closest thing to miniature grizzly bears, a fact which is\nof course entirely unrelated to their remarkable characteristics as party\nanimals (the hamsters, not the bears, though they might qualify, too…). The\npurpose of the hamster at Ted’s party is thus twofold: In the unlikely event\nthat a discussion of Xanadu’s future turns into an attempt to establish the\nSeasteading Republic Of Hypertext, someone needs to keep the engines chugging\nalong. And secondly, you need a fluent German speaker to reminisce about Wagner\nwith Werner (coincidentally also the title of the longest running radio show in\nNigeria’s Yiddish enclave).\n\n\n\nHerb Quine:\nYou walk down to the shore to buy a new edition of “Learning Perl”, as you do\nevery Thursday. But when you reach the ice cube factory, you suddenly realize\nthat Unicode is pointless. Sure, you can play quite a few nice little language\ngames with all these emojis they keep adding, but the burrow only goes so far.\nAnd then you hit the parking lot of the Consortium’s reserved committee parking\nspaces and tumble head first onto the seat of a convertible. Which makes sense,\nI guess, until you realize that the wonderful weather of the bay area is no\nbueno for rhizomes and others of their ilk. They need constant watering, don’t\nthey?\n\n\nHerb Quine:\nSorry, was there a question?\n\n\nHerb Quine:\nYeah, all right, enough with the rambling. Let’s get down to business. What’s\nyour affiliation with the FBI and are you or have you ever been an agent engaged\nin any work of endeavor related to printables, convertibles, mazes or any\ncombination thereof?\n\n\nHerb Quine:\nI can neither confirm nor deny the existence of the information sought. Also,\nclassical logic is overrated and all these lying Cretan hipsters are not nearly\nas interesting as they think. If you ask me, and you just did, they are just\nlazy bums who came up with this lying-business as an excuse to get out of the\nreal work of building tremendously beautiful walls like real Cretans do. These\nkids nowadays, let me tell you…\n\n\nHerb Quine:\nDat / Hypercore / Beaker sure look very interesting, but aren’t they a technical\nsolution to a problem of the medium? One great aspect of Fraidycat is that it\ndoesn’t care how established or indie your chosen medium is, in a way it feels\nas if Fraidycat is rerouting and connecting existing media to extend and create\nnew media. It doesn’t care if you’re Kylie Jenner or Ted Nelson, it doesn’t\n(much) care about the underlying technology, because it changes the topology of\nthe existing pieces while not denying that centralized sub-parts of the network\nstill exist. Is a more foundational project like Dat / Hypercore / Beaker\northogonal to that idea?\n\n\n\nHerb Quine:\nI know I’m mostly answering rhetorical questions at this point, but this is one\nthat I’m really not sure how to answer. I do love the spirit of Dat / Hypercore\n/ Beaker, I am just a bit suspicious of any attempts to revive the good parts of\nthe personal web without paying attention to why it became less important as a\nmedium (the non-app-web, that is), because I would be hesitant to point to\ntechnical reasons. To me, IPFS and SSB in particular often look like solutions\nthat fix all the underlying tech in a very admirable way, without really\nchanging the medium that they are producing or favoring. A decentralized\nFacebook will still result in a medium very much like Facebook, just at a\ndisadvantage because the technical forces can never be fully aligned with the\nforces of the medium.[2] I do think that Dat / Hypercore / Beaker are not as\nsusceptible in this regard and I really hope that they do not end up emulating\nexisting media too much. But really, I don’t know, what do you think?\n\n\nHerb Quine:\nIs the treasure hunt over? What are we supposed to do now? Wait for National\nTreasure III? IS THIS REALLY IT? What about CGI Youngface and all the hard shell\nkayaks that are still lying around in undiscovered places on the globe? What\nabout annie dark?\n\n\n\nHerb Quine:\nYeah, I don’t think I’m equipped to answer this one. But damn, it was an amazing\nride so far.\n\n\n\n\nIn an attempt to shed some light on what is going on here, this\nperson DOES preface the interview with a note to me which reads: “I am\nwriting you this electronic letter to defuse the somewhat bizarre situation of\nhaving sent you an unsolicited printable maze that perhaps put you in an\nawkward position. After all, how are you supposed to react to such a strange\nand perhaps unexpected offering from a stranger on the internet? Well, since\nthe printable maze in question has already escaped into the tubular ether,\nthere is no going back and we might as well get to know each other a little\nbetter, what do you say?” (That other e-mail is reprinted in\nA Verbal History of the Infinitely Printable Maze, for completeness’ sake.) ↩︎\n\nFine, fine, I’ll cut in here. Can’t you lot just interview yourselves and\ngotdamn leave me out of it??I feel what you saying so acutely - making\na distributed web is actually a minor change on the surface - who would\nnotice? (And I’m levels down: not a zealot - I just think it’s fun.)\nBut I think there are cascading effects. When the app and the data and\nthe whole thing is on Facebook’s servers, that has implications. And when the\napp and the data and the whole are on home computers, that has\nimplications.For me, Beaker DOES pay attention to the original good\npart: view source. It brings view source to the modern ‘ye-app-web’ relevant\npart you speak of. That’s all. ↩︎"
