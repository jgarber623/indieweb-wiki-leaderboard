The most glaring example is his ostenisbly sincere apology for failing to hire women writers on Mr. Show, despite a circle of qualified women in their core group of friends, many of whom were hired as performers. He wishes he had hired women and regrets that he can't do anything to correct that mistake now, and you might easily picture him wringing his hat and kicking sheepishly at the dirt. (He's so dadgummed awful sorry!)</p>\n<p>But fast forward to the pseudo-reboot of Mr. Show, Netflix's W/Bob &amp; David, and here was his big chance to correct that earlier wrong, the one he wished so earnestly he had an opportunity to do over again. But he doesn't. Odenkirk gushes about the reunited writing staff, naming the same core list of men from the original run of the show, and he is so proud of it. Putting to lie his earlier regret, he couldn't even attempt to conjure a defense.</p>\n<p>He repeatedly assures us throughout the book that he doesn't have any \"bro\" in him, while repeatedly apologizing for making very \"bro-y\" decisions.
