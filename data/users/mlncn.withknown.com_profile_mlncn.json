The use of these electroshock weapons, Tasers, are common in police departments across the United States.\r\n\r\nThere is not yet evidence the murder was premeditated, but whether or not it was, the unnecessary shooting is another indication that the whole damn system is guilty as hell.\r\n\r\nThe community, minus some equivocation from its newly elevated elected representatives, is remarkably collected and cohesive in its response.\r\n\r\nThat this is not justifiable.  That it was an act of cowardice by the police.\r\n\r\nBeing imperfect, having a gun (or having one placed next to you after you are dead), are not reasons for being murdered.  The community stands ready to defend the victim from the smear campaign that police departments and \r\n\r\nA man identified as Mel, a community organizer [ must be https://twitter.com/mellaneous1 ], laid out to Unicorn Riot the unspoken subtext of events like these, that the lethal violence is one small part of a smothering repression:\r\n\r\nHappens again and again.  Common sense tells you this is on purpose.  The reason the kid is laying in the street is because their real role is to show us whose boss.  They shoot us every once in a while to let us know if we get out of hand this is what happens to you too."
