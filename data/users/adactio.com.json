I also got lots of gasps and pearl-clutching, as though I were saying something taboo. Welcome to San Francisco.</p>\n\n<p>Lola gave as good as she got. I got a roasting in her talk.</p>\n\n<p>And just to clarify, Lola and I are friends—this was a consensual smackdown.</p>\n\n<p>There was a very serious point to Lola’s talk. Cryptobollocks and other blockchain-powered schemes have historically been <em>very</em> bro-y, and exploitative of non-bro communities. Lola wants to fight that trend.</p>\n\n<p>I get it. But it reminds me a bit of the justifications you hear from people who go to work at Facebook claiming that they can do more good from the inside. Whatever helps you sleep at night.</p>\n\n<p>The crux of Lola’s belief is this: blockchain technology is inevitable, therefore it is uncumbent on us as ethical designers to ensure that the technology is deployed in a way that empowers people instead of exploiting them.</p>\n\n<p>But I take issue with the premise. Blockchain technology is not inevitable. That’s the worst kind of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_determinism\">technological determinism</a>. It’s defeatist. It’s a depressing view of “progress” driven not by people, but by technological forces beyond our control.</p>\n\n<p>I refuse to accept that anti-humanist deterministic view.</p>\n\n<p>In any case, for technological determinism to have any validity, there needs to be something to it. At least virtual reality and machine learning are based on some actual technologies. In the case of cryptobollocks, there is no <em>there</em> there. There is nothing <em>except</em> the hype, which is why you’ll see blockchain enthusiasts trying to ride the coattails of trending technologies in a logical fallacy that goes something like this:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>There are technologies that will be really big in the future,</li>\n<li>blockchain is a technology, therefore</li>\n<li>blockchain will be really big in the future.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Blockchain is bullshit.

One thing to keep in mind is this: remember when everyone was talking about “The Cloud”? And then it turned out that you could substitute the phrase “someone else’s server” for “The Cloud?” Well, every time you hear Lola say the word “blockchain”, I’d like you to mentally substitute the phrase “multiple copies of a spreadsheet.”\n\n  Please give an open mind and a warm welcome to Lola Oyelayo Pearson!\n\n\nI got some laughs. I also got lots of gasps and pearl-clutching, as though I were saying something taboo. Welcome to San Francisco.\n\nLola gave as good as she got. I got a roasting in her talk.\n\nAnd just to clarify, Lola and I are friends—this was a consensual smackdown.\n\nThere was a very serious point to Lola’s talk. Cryptobollocks and other blockchain-powered schemes have historically been very bro-y, and exploitative of non-bro communities. Lola wants to fight that trend.\n\nI get it. But it reminds me a bit of the justifications you hear from people who go to work at Facebook claiming that they can do more good from the inside. Whatever helps you sleep at night.\n\nThe crux of Lola’s belief is this: blockchain technology is inevitable, therefore it is uncumbent on us as ethical designers to ensure that the technology is deployed in a way that empowers people instead of exploiting them.\n\nBut I take issue with the premise. Blockchain technology is not inevitable. That’s the worst kind of technological determinism. It’s defeatist. It’s a depressing view of “progress” driven not by people, but by technological forces beyond our control.\n\nI refuse to accept that anti-humanist deterministic view.\n\nIn any case, for technological determinism to have any validity, there needs to be something to it. At least virtual reality and machine learning are based on some actual technologies. In the case of cryptobollocks, there is no there there. There is nothing except the hype, which is why you’ll see blockchain enthusiasts trying to ride the coattails of trending technologies in a logical fallacy that goes something like this:\n\n\nThere are technologies that will be really big in the future,\nblockchain is a technology, therefore\nblockchain will be really big in the future.\n\n\nBlockchain is bullshit. It isn’t even very clever bullshit. And it certainly isn’t inevitable."
