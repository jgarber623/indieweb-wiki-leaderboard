When I syndicate to Twitter, I make a conscious choice each time. There’s a “Twitter” toggle that I can enable or disable in my posting interface. Mastodon deserved the same level of thoughtfulness.</p>\n\n<p>So I switched off the IFTTT recipe and started exploring <a href=\"https://docs.joinmastodon.org/api/\">the Mastodon API</a>. It’s going to sound like a humblebrag when I tell you that I got cross-posting working in almost no time at all, but that’s not a testament to my coding prowess (I’m really not very good), but rather a testament to the Mastodon API, which was a joy to work with.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>On your Mastodon instance, go to <code>/settings/applications</code>.</li>\n<li>Click on <code>New Application</code>.</li>\n<li>Fill in the details about your website and select <code>write:statuses</code> (and probably <code>write:media</code>) from the Scopes list.</li>\n<li>Copy <code>Your access token</code> to use in API calls.</li>\n<li>Write <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/adactio/c3652f2241c29bdc5af116bb02594d61\">some sloppy code</a> (in my case, PHP that uses CURL).</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I did hit a wall when it came to posting images. That took me a while to get working, and I couldn’t figure out why. Was it something at Mastodon’s end while it was struggling under the influx of new users? As it turns out, no. It was entirely down to me being an idiot. (You know that situation where you’re working on a problem for ages and you’ve become convinced it’s an extremely gnarly rocket-science problem, but then turns out to be something stupid like a typo? Yeah. That.)</p>\n\n<p>Then there’s the whole question of how to receive replies, likes, and reboosts from Mastodon here on my own site. Luckily, that was super easy, thanks to <a href=\"https://brid.gy/\">Brid.gy</a>. One click and I was done. I love Brid.gy!</p>\n\n<p>Take <a href=\"https://adactio.com/notes/19615\">this note, for example</a>. There’s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/adactio/status/1592231930304466944\">a version on Twitter</a> and <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@adactio/109343712638768951\">a version on Mastodon</a>. The original version on my own site gets responses from both places.</p>\n\n<p>If <a href=\"https://adactio.com/notes/19616\">I’m replying</a> to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nutsmuggler/status/1592236101124739073\">a response on Twitter</a>, I do <em>not</em> syndicate that to Mastodon.</p>\n\n<p>Likewise, if <a href=\"https://adactio.com/notes/19639\">I’m replying</a> to <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@sgarrity/109353762964696165\">a response on Mastodon</a>, I do <em>not</em> syndicate that to Twitter.</p>\n\n<p>Oh, one thing worth mentioning: if you’re sending a reply to something on Mastodon using the API, there’s an <code>in_reply_to_id</code> field for you to provide. But you should also include the full @username@instance of the person you’re replying to at the beginning of the message to ensure that it’s displayed as a reply rather than showing up as a regular post. Note the difference between <a href=\"https://adactio.com/notes/19639\">this note on my site</a> and <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@adactio/109352196388205690\">its syndicated version on Mastodon</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, now I’m posting to Mastodon, but I’m doing it through the the interface of my own website.

But as I’m making a conscious decision whenever I syndicate to Mastodon, I think I’m going to leave that checkbox unticked.</p>\n\n<p>My cross-posting is not automated and I’m very much monitoring my Mastodon account …because I’m enjoying my Mastodon experience more than I’ve enjoyed anything online for quite some time.
