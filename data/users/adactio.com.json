She was going to quote <a href=\"https://adactio.com/journal/19514\">that blog post</a>. Before the talk, I asked her how obnoxious I could be about blockchain in her intro. She told me to bring it.</p>\n\n<p>So in the introduction, I deployed all the sarcasm I had in me and said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Listen, we designers have a tendency to be over-critical of things sometimes. There are all these ideas that we dismiss: phrenology, homeopathy, flat-earthism ‚Ä¶blockchain. Haters gonna hate.</p>\n\n  <p>I remember somebody asking online a while back, ‚ÄúWhy the hate for web3?‚Äù And someone I know responded by saying ‚ÄúWe hate it because we understand it.‚Äù I think there‚Äôs a lot of truth to that.</p>\n\n  <p>But look, just because blockchains are powering crypto ponzi schemes and N F fucking Ts, it‚Äôs worth remembering that it‚Äôs also simply a technology. It‚Äôs a technological solution in search of a problem.</p>\n\n  <p>To be fair, it‚Äôs still early days. After all, it‚Äôs only been <em>over a decade now</em>.</p>\n\n  <p>It‚Äôs like the law of instrument says; when all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. Blockchain is like that. Except the hammer is also made of glass.</p>\n\n  <p>Anyway, Lola is going to defend the indefensible and talk about blockchain. One thing to keep in mind is this: remember when everyone was talking about ‚ÄúThe Cloud‚Äù?

            "value": "I‚Äôve already written about how much I enjoyed hosting Leading Design San Francisco last week.\n\nAll the speakers were terrific. Lola‚Äôs talk was particularly ‚Ä¶um, interesting:\n\n\n  In this talk, Lola will share her adventures in the world of blockchain, the hostility she experienced in her first go-round in 2018, and why she‚Äôs chosen to head back to a technology that is going through its largest reputational and social crisis to date.\n\n\nWait ‚Ä¶I was supposed to stand on stage and introduce a talk that was (at least partly) about blockchain? I have opinions.\n\nAs it turned out, Lola warned me that I‚Äôd be making an appearance in her talk. She was going to quote that blog post. Before the talk, I asked her how obnoxious I could be about blockchain in her intro. She told me to bring it.\n\nSo in the introduction, I deployed all the sarcasm I had in me and said:\n\n\n  Listen, we designers have a tendency to be over-critical of things sometimes. There are all these ideas that we dismiss: phrenology, homeopathy, flat-earthism ‚Ä¶blockchain. Haters gonna hate.\n\n  I remember somebody asking online a while back, ‚ÄúWhy the hate for web3?‚Äù And someone I know responded by saying ‚ÄúWe hate it because we understand it.‚Äù I think there‚Äôs a lot of truth to that.\n\n  But look, just because blockchains are powering crypto ponzi schemes and N F fucking Ts, it‚Äôs worth remembering that it‚Äôs also simply a technology. It‚Äôs a technological solution in search of a problem.\n\n  To be fair, it‚Äôs still early days. After all, it‚Äôs only been over a decade now.\n\n  It‚Äôs like the law of instrument says; when all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. Blockchain is like that. Except the hammer is also made of glass.\n\n  Anyway, Lola is going to defend the indefensible and talk about blockchain. One thing to keep in mind is this: remember when everyone was talking about ‚ÄúThe Cloud‚Äù?

            "html": "<p>I‚Äôve mentioned before that <a href=\"https://adactio.com/journal/17770\">I‚Äôm not a fan of initialisms and acronyms</a>. They can be exclusionary.</p>\n\n<p>It bothers me doubly when everyone is talking about AI.</p>\n\n<p>First of all, the term is so vague as to be meaningless. Sometimes‚Äîthough rarely‚ÄîAI refers to general artificial intelligence. Sometimes AI refers to machine learning. Sometimes AI refers to large language models. Sometimes AI refers to a series of <code>if</code>/<code>else</code> statements. That‚Äôs quite a spectrum of meaning.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, there‚Äôs the assumption that everyone understands the abbreviation. I guess that‚Äôs generally a safe assumption, but sometimes AI could refer to something other than artificial intelligence.</p>\n\n<p>In countries with plenty of pastoral agriculture, if someone works in AI, it usually means they‚Äôre going from farm to farm either extracting or injecting animal semen. AI stands for artificial insemination.</p>\n\n<p>I think that abbreviation might work <em>better</em> for the kind of things currently described as using AI.</p>\n\n<p>We were discussing this hot topic at work recently. Is AI coming for our jobs? The consensus was maybe, but only the parts of our jobs that we‚Äôre more than happy to have automated. Like summarising some some findings. Or perhaps as a kind of lorem ipsum generator. Or for just getting the ball rolling with a design direction. <a href=\"https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2023/02/playing-with-midjourney-art-for-non-artists/\">As Terence puts it</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Midjourney is <em>great</em> for a first draft. If, like me, you struggle to give shape to your ideas then it is nothing short of magic. It gets you through the first 90% of the hard work. It‚Äôs then up to you to refine things.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That‚Äôs pretty much the conclusion we came to in our discussion at Clearleft. There‚Äôs no way that we‚Äôd use this technology to generate <em>outputs</em> for clients, but we certainly might use it to generate <em>inputs</em>.

            "value": "I‚Äôve mentioned before that I‚Äôm not a fan of initialisms and acronyms. They can be exclusionary.\n\nIt bothers me doubly when everyone is talking about AI.\n\nFirst of all, the term is so vague as to be meaningless. Sometimes‚Äîthough rarely‚ÄîAI refers to general artificial intelligence. Sometimes AI refers to machine learning. Sometimes AI refers to large language models. Sometimes AI refers to a series of if/else statements. That‚Äôs quite a spectrum of meaning.\n\nSecondly, there‚Äôs the assumption that everyone understands the abbreviation. I guess that‚Äôs generally a safe assumption, but sometimes AI could refer to something other than artificial intelligence.\n\nIn countries with plenty of pastoral agriculture, if someone works in AI, it usually means they‚Äôre going from farm to farm either extracting or injecting animal semen. AI stands for artificial insemination.\n\nI think that abbreviation might work better for the kind of things currently described as using AI.\n\nWe were discussing this hot topic at work recently. Is AI coming for our jobs? The consensus was maybe, but only the parts of our jobs that we‚Äôre more than happy to have automated. Like summarising some some findings. Or perhaps as a kind of lorem ipsum generator. Or for just getting the ball rolling with a design direction. As Terence puts it:\n\n\n  Midjourney is great for a first draft. If, like me, you struggle to give shape to your ideas then it is nothing short of magic. It gets you through the first 90% of the hard work. It‚Äôs then up to you to refine things.\n\n\nThat‚Äôs pretty much the conclusion we came to in our discussion at Clearleft.
