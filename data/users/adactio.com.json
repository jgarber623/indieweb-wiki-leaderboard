I worry that it‚Äôs yet another form of hygiene theatre (like providing anti-<em>bacterial</em> handwash for an airborne <em>virus</em>). After all, the antigen tests are most effective when you‚Äôve already got symptoms. Taking a test when you don‚Äôt have symptoms might well give a negative result, but it doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean you don‚Äôt have Covid. Still, it‚Äôs a little intervention that might catch an infection that otherwise would‚Äôve spread further.</p>\n\n<p>I‚Äôm assuming that everyone coming to dConstruct is vaccinated. Maybe that‚Äôs naive on my part, but I figure if you‚Äôre intelligent enough to get a dConstruct ticket, you‚Äôre intelligent enough to protect yourself and others. So we won‚Äôt be requesting proof of vaccination. I hope my naivety aligns with reality.</p>\n\n<p>See, this is all one more thing for my brain to gnaw on when I should be thinking about what a fantastic day of talks I‚Äôve got ahead of me. Roll on tomorrow!</p>",

Would you mind getting a hold of a Covid test sometime in the next week and taking a test a day or two before dConstruct? (And if you test positive, please don‚Äôt come to the event.)\n  \n  If you can‚Äôt get hold of a test (I know it can be tricky), then could you please bring a mask to wear when inside the venue?\n\n\nI think asking everyone to take a test is a reasonable request, and nobody has objected to it. I worry that it‚Äôs yet another form of hygiene theatre (like providing anti-bacterial handwash for an airborne virus). After all, the antigen tests are most effective when you‚Äôve already got symptoms. Taking a test when you don‚Äôt have symptoms might well give a negative result, but it doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean you don‚Äôt have Covid. Still, it‚Äôs a little intervention that might catch an infection that otherwise would‚Äôve spread further.\n\nI‚Äôm assuming that everyone coming to dConstruct is vaccinated. Maybe that‚Äôs naive on my part, but I figure if you‚Äôre intelligent enough to get a dConstruct ticket, you‚Äôre intelligent enough to protect yourself and others. So we won‚Äôt be requesting proof of vaccination. I hope my naivety aligns with reality.\n\nSee, this is all one more thing for my brain to gnaw on when I should be thinking about what a fantastic day of talks I‚Äôve got ahead of me. Roll on tomorrow!"
