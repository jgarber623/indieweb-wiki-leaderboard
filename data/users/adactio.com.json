I thought it would be good to switch over to using <a href=\"https://web.dev/learn/css/logical-properties/\">logical properties</a> exclusively. I did this partly to make the site more easily translatable into languages with different writing modes, but mostly as an exercise to help train <em>me</em> in thinking with logical properties by default.</p>\n\n<p>All in all, it went pretty smoothly. You can kick the tyres by opening up dev tools on <a href=\"https://thesession.org/\">The Session</a> and adding a <code>writing-mode</code> declaration to the <code>body</code> or <code>html</code> element.</p>\n\n<p>For the most part, the switchover was smooth. It mostly involved swapping out property names with <code>left</code>, <code>right</code>, <code>top</code>, and <code>bottom</code> for <code>inline-start</code>, <code>inline-end</code>, <code>block-start</code>, and <code>block-end</code>.</p>\n\n<p>The <code>border-radius</code> properties tripped me up a little. You have to use shorthand like <code>border-start-end-radius</code>, not <code>border-block-start-inline-end-radius</code> (that doesn’t exist). So you have to keep the order of the properties in mind:</p>\n\n<p><code>\nborder-{{block direction}}-{{inline-direction}}-radius\n</code></p>\n\n<p>Speaking of shorthand, I also had to kiss some shorthand declarations goodbye. Let’s say I use this shorthand for something like <code>margin</code> or <code>padding</code>:</p>\n\n<p><code>\nmargin: 1em 1.5em 2em 0.5em;\n</code></p>\n\n<p>Those values get applied to <code>margin-top</code>, <code>margin-right</code>, <code>margin-bottom</code>, and <code>margin-left</code>, <em>not</em> the logical equivalents (<code>block-start</code>, <code>inline-end</code>, <code>block-end</code>, and <code>inline-start</code>). So separate declarations are needed instead:</p>\n\n<p><code><pre>\nmargin-block-start: 1em;\nmargin-inline-end: 1.5em;\nmargin-block-end: 2em;\nmargin-inline-start: 0.5em;\n</pre></code></p>\n\n<p>Same goes for shorthand like this:</p>\n\n<p><code>\nmargin: 1em 2em;\n</code></p>\n\n<p>That needs to be written as two declarations:</p>\n\n<p><code><pre>\nmargin-block: 1em;\nmargin-inline: 2em;\n</pre></code></p>\n\n<p>Now <a href=\"https://adactio.com/journal/18640\">I’ve said it before</a> and I’ll say it again: it feels really weird that you can’t use logical properties in media queries. Although as I said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Now you could rightly argue that in this instance we’re talking about the physical dimensions of the viewport. So maybe width and height make more sense than inline and block.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But along comes the new kid on the block (or inline), <a href=\"https://web.dev/learn/design/micro-layouts/#container-queries\">container queries</a>, ready to roll with <code>container-type</code> values like <code>inline-size</code>. I hope it’s just a matter of time until we can use logical properties in all our conditional queries.</p>\n\n<p>The other place where there’s still a cognitive mismatch is in transforms and animations. We’ve got a <code>translateX()</code> function but no <code>translate-inline()</code>. We’ve got <code>translateY()</code> but no <code>translate-block()</code>.</p>\n\n<p>On <a href=\"https://thesession.org/\">The Session</a> I’m using some JavaScript to figure out the details of some animation effects. I’m using methods like <code>getBoundingClientRect()</code>. It doesn’t return logical properties. So if I ever want to adjust my animations based on writing direction, I’ll need to fork my JavaScript code.</p>\n\n<p>Oh, and one other thing: the <code>aspect-ratio</code> property takes values in the form of <code>width/height</code>, not <code>inline/block</code>. That makes sense if you’re dealing with images, videos, or other embedded content but it makes it really tricky to use <code>aspect-ratio</code> on elements that contain text. I mean, it works fine as long as the text is in a language using a top-to-bottom writing mode, but not for any other languages.</p>",
