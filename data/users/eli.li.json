The good news is that the repair has officially cured my brain bleed! The bad news is that they saw another vessel that looks primed to bleed; I’m due for another repair procedure sometime in October. I’m pretty bummed to not be done with this ordeal, but trying to remain optimistic that this new one was caught before it bled and because the surgeon says this one seems easier to repair than the first.\nI’m still struggling to focus long enough to pick up major programming tasks at hobby time (I desperately wanna make this game that I’ve been noodling over and over for months now).
