Story of my life.\n\t\t\t\t\tI spent nearly ten years working on websites and doing\n\t\t\t\t\t\"coding\" (for whatever values of that you're willing to\n\t\t\t\t\taccept for writing \n\t\t\t\t\tPHP). This was a position I inherited\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause I had tinkered with it as a kid and had an affinity\n\t\t\t\t\tfor it. I was far from being a professional.\n\t\t\t\t\tI often have to remind myself that I am not:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tA developer\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAn artist or creative type\n\t\t\t\t\t\tA systems engineer\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tI have an expertise in doing desktop support. That's\n\t\t\t\t\tpretty much it. Everything else is just me learning enough\n\t\t\t\t\tto be, as Kev puts: \"dangerous\". I sometimes think that\n\t\t\t\t\teveryone behaves this way, and no one is a expert. However,\n\t\t\t\t\tthat is clearly not the case. People may not know every\n\t\t\t\t\taspect of a thing they have expertise in. However, for all\n\t\t\t\t\tintents and purposes, they're an 'expert'. I just wish I\n\t\t\t\t\tknew where the line was.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tðŸ”— Permalink to this post."

I don't even know why I bother with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tanything Aral has to say. He's such a blowhard, spinning up\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprojects that he has no intention of finishing, or even\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsupporting when he's bored of it. I guess this is a \"shame on\n\t\t\t\t\t\tme\" moment.\n\t\t\t\t\tNot 3 years ago, Aral was talking\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tabout how their iOS ad-blocking app \"Better Blocker\" was doing\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmiddlingly well, but gave them a decent chunk of change a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyear (more than some make doing actual jobs). Now,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbecause Apple didn't fight doing searches for child pornography\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton people's photos, they've taken it down.\n\t\t\t\t\tMind you, Better Blocker was a paid appliction. One\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat required only maintenance to stay in line with the app\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstore rules and to throw up block list updates on some external\n\t\t\t\t\t\tserver. Not exactly rocket science. When they took down their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tapp, they didn't even bother to tell paid users. It just stops\n\t\t\t\t\t\tupdating. The app page is unavailable and there is nothing but a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tblog post on his personal site about it. Wonderful.\n\t\t\t\t\tWhat a pretentious douchebag. If you want to steer clear of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnon-profits doing more harm than good, then stay away from the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tso-called \"Small Technology Foundation\". Nothing good comes from\n\t\t\t\t\t\teither of these two grifters using the guise of non-profit to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlive a privleged life..\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tðŸ”— Permalink to this post."
