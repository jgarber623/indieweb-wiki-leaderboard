While there isn't much but bling to\n\t\t\t\t\tnote, one of the useful features I found out about\n\t\t\t\t\twas a medicine tracker.

Some mistakes or mixups are going\n\t\t\t\t\tto happen. However, the biggest criticisms seem to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe about the female leads themselves.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>I find this particular point exhausting and\n\t\t\t\t\tdisheartening.

It\n\t\t\t\t\tnot only provides more insight into the mind of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe characters and what they go through, but it\n\t\t\t\t\talso makes you realize just how much shit the\n\t\t\t\t\taverage woman has to go through just to\n\t\t\t\t\t<em>exist</em>.

                "value": "She-Hulk is amazing. Marvel fans? Eh. Many of\n\t\t\t\t\tthem are worse than some of the villans. I say\n\t\t\t\t\tthat because every new episode of any\n\t\t\t\t\tshow (especially ones with female leads),\n\t\t\t\t\tgets picked apart on an atomic scale. Sure, there\n\t\t\t\t\tare lots of different easter eggs and nods to\n\t\t\t\t\tother shows/movies and it feels fantastic when you\n\t\t\t\t\tnotice them, but the people producing these shows\n\t\t\t\t\tare also human. Some mistakes or mixups are going\n\t\t\t\t\tto happen. However, the biggest criticisms seem to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe about the female leads themselves.\n\t\t\t\t\tI find this particular point exhausting and\n\t\t\t\t\tdisheartening. Are so many men that\n\t\t\t\t\tinsecure that they can't enjoy something if\n\t\t\t\t\tthey're not explicitly represented as the\n\t\t\t\t\tlead role? They seem to posess an ego so fragile\n\t\t\t\t\tthat it seems like the mere idea of there being a\n\t\t\t\t\tstrong female lead (good or bad) is enough to draw\n\t\t\t\t\tmore than their fair share of ire. At least\n\t\t\t\t\tthey're posting them where we can see them and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshame them.\n\t\t\t\t\tI, for one, am enjoying this sort of…\n\t\t\t\t\t\"girl power\" moment going on in the MCU. It\n\t\t\t\t\tnot only provides more insight into the mind of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe characters and what they go through, but it\n\t\t\t\t\talso makes you realize just how much shit the\n\t\t\t\t\taverage woman has to go through just to\n\t\t\t\t\texist. Let alone what a super-powered\n\t\t\t\t\twoman has to endure.\n\t\t\t\t\tSo, bring it on, Marvel. I know that She-Hulk\n\t\t\t\t\tis leaning in to poking the haters, but lets see\n\t\t\t\t\tsome more powerful women on the screen.

We're getting a bunch of new-hires in\n\t\t\t\t\tthat will be using them, so we need to ensure\n\t\t\t\t\tthey'll work with our enviornment. While that's\n\t\t\t\t\tnot really a concern of mine, I understood that\n\t\t\t\t\tthis came from higher up on the food chain, and\n\t\t\t\t\tdid what I needed to do.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>One thing I like to pride myself on is being\n\t\t\t\t\tversitile. I can use lots of different operating\n\t\t\t\t\tenvironments and still be mostly productive. While\n\t\t\t\t\tI have a some Windows-centric things for my\n\t\t\t\t\tposition, the rest is mostly just email and phone\n\t\t\t\t\tcalls.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>For a lot of my life, I was an Apple user. I\n\t\t\t\t\thad a big 'ole Grey iMac G3 and a Powerbook G4 as\n\t\t\t\t\twell as varying newer models. I've also been a\n\t\t\t\t\tlong time iPhone user, which makes being a Mac\n\t\t\t\t\tuser an easy decision, especially as the two\n\t\t\t\t\tplatforms have grown closer. I've also been a\n\t\t\t\t\tfrequent Linux user and a professional Windows\n\t\t\t\t\tsupport jockey. Finding middle ground between all\n\t\t\t\t\tof these platforms hasn't been easy, and usually\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttakes a heaping amount of compromise.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Recently, though I can't find the blog post it\n\t\t\t\t\twas in, I expressed interest in going \"all in\"\n\t\t\t\t\twith Apple. I already use their phones, their\n\t\t\t\t\tmusic and movies, I may as well settle in for a\n\t\t\t\t\twell integrated (at the cost of being more\n\t\t\t\t\tflexible) experience and let my fortunes be what\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit may.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>However.

We're getting a bunch of new-hires in\n\t\t\t\t\tthat will be using them, so we need to ensure\n\t\t\t\t\tthey'll work with our enviornment. While that's\n\t\t\t\t\tnot really a concern of mine, I understood that\n\t\t\t\t\tthis came from higher up on the food chain, and\n\t\t\t\t\tdid what I needed to do.\n\t\t\t\t\tOne thing I like to pride myself on is being\n\t\t\t\t\tversitile.

Do I need to pay\n\t\t\t\t\tfor every service I want to use? That\n\t\t\t\t\tseems counter-productive or at the very least\n\t\t\t\t\texclusionary to less well off users. It also\n\t\t\t\t\tbrings up the idea of what is part of the critical\n\t\t\t\t\tinfrastructure of the Internet. DNS, HTTP, SSL\n\t\t\t\t\tCertificates, routing... all behind the scenes\n\t\t\t\t\tservices, all paid for by someone,\n\t\t\t\t\tusually a provider of some kind. However, what\n\t\t\t\t\twould it be like to pay for all of those things\n\t\t\t\t\tala carte? Would they bundle? What kind of\n\t\t\t\t\tfragmented access would that provide? Should we\n\t\t\t\t\tadd search to that stack? I know that search isn't\n\t\t\t\t\ta protocol, but it seems like the web is\n\t\t\t\t\tprohibitively large enough to need it. While I\n\t\t\t\t\tunderstand the problem is complex enough, that\n\t\t\t\t\tmaking it free without some kind of compensation\n\t\t\t\t\tis kind of a big ask, even for large companies\n\t\t\t\t\twith the capital to fund it. It still seems like a\n\t\t\t\t\tfundamental part of how we use the\n\t\t\t\t\tweb.\n\t\t\t\t\tSearch seems to be moving into an interesting\n\t\t\t\t\tplace. Despite the size and complexity of it,\n\t\t\t\t\tthere\n\t\t\t\t\tis strong\n\t\t\t\t\theadway in making it more digestible and\n\t\t\t\t\teasier to index through\n\t\t\t\t\tmany open-source\n\t\t\t\t\tprojects. While not on the scale of their\n\t\t\t\t\tfor-profit fore-bearers, they will seemingly make\n\t\t\t\t\tsome kind of waves in the world of search. I could\n\t\t\t\t\treasonably foresee a future where such indexes are\n\t\t\t\t\tdistributed and each user has a small indexer that\n\t\t\t\t\tscrapes what is visited and distributes it to an\n\t\t\t\t\taggregator. Though, that's also fraught with\n\t\t\t\t\tproblems.\n\t\t\t\t\tI don't know if I like where this is all\n\t\t\t\t\tgoing. We've had this duopoly for ages now, and it\n\t\t\t\t\tseems like there is no quantitative relief in\n\t\t\t\t\tsight if you want a robust search engine that\n\t\t\t\t\trespects your privacy, gives you good results, and\n\t\t\t\t\tis accountable\n\t\t\t\t\tto you. Given how\n\t\t\t\t\tmuch any average search engine knows about your\n\t\t\t\t\tpersonality through your\n\t\t\t\t\tsearches, it\n\t\t\t\t\tprobably knows as much as your phone does, and\n\t\t\t\t\tthat's a lot."

                "value": "So, I'm going on a little trip with my\n                    family. It's going to be a long airline ride, and\n                    probably more driving on top of that. So, in order\n                    to help with duration, and to help cut down on the\n                    screen time, I've started looking, again, into\n                    print and play games.\n                    I've done this once before, during the pandemic (well,\n                    it's still the pandemic, but 2 years on\n                    already…).

Many of these I just sent to Kinkos/FedEx/Whatever to\n\t\t\t\t\tget printed on nice stock or lamenated for multiple plays.\n\t\t\t\t\tThis time, I've chosen a few new ones.\n\t\t\t\t\tI was really tempted to print\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGloomholdin'\n\t\t\t\t\t,\n\t\t\t\t\tbut I tend not to be in the mood to play something complex\n\t\t\t\t\tin a confined space. I'd rather spread out and enjoy a\n\t\t\t\t\tcomplex experience. Travel also makes complex things\n\t\t\t\t\tfrustrating.

Spoilers: He does so.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Jiro's sushi is served in the style of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omakase\">omakase</a>,\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttranslated as \"I'll leave it up to you [the chef]\". You don't\n\t\t\t\t\t\torder food like you would at a traditional resturant. You come\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin, sit down and are fed what the chef has in mind for the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnight. Sometimes this is pre-set for a particular season,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsometimes it changes on the chef's whim or availability of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tingredients.

                "value": "Once upon a time, I watched a movie/documentary called \"Jiro\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDreams of Sushi\", a delightful film about this master sushi\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchef that has a small, but extremely exclusive sushi resturant\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the bottom of a Tokyo office building. Jiro,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe titular character, is a man driven by the desire to perfect\n\t\t\t\t\t\this sushi and delight his patrons. Spoilers: He does so.\n\t\t\t\t\tJiro's sushi is served in the style of omakase,\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttranslated as \"I'll leave it up to you [the chef]\". You don't\n\t\t\t\t\t\torder food like you would at a traditional resturant. You come\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin, sit down and are fed what the chef has in mind for the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnight. Sometimes this is pre-set for a particular season,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsometimes it changes on the chef's whim or availability of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tingredients. Regardless, it's a very facinating experience.\n\t\t\t\t\tThat all being said, my\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twife recently discovered that there is an omakase-style\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tresturant in town that is just sort of getting started. It's\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgot a small, ten-person seating for the omakase event and she\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgot us seats for our anniversary. What a delight it was. I've\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnever had sushi like this, nor have I had any sushi that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcompares.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Norikase \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe resturant is small.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Norikase \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNorikase is cozy, though.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Norikase Drink Menu \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe drink menu.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Delightfully simple setup \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDelightfully simple setup\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t One of the hand washing napkins (compressed) \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOne of the hand washing napkins (compressed)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe interior is very intmate.

Hence, my abstinence.\n\t\t\t\t\tTo help fill that void, I've decided that I want to journal\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmore. I got a book and a pen and I've been writing. I also have\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis blog to help me with that. Despite my misgivings around\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWordPress, I've tabled them until I can get my head and life\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstraightened out.\n\t\t\t\t\tI'm going to take this opportunity to take a good hard look\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat myself and what I get out of the tools and systems I use. I\n\t\t\t\t\t\twant to be enriched by things, not dragged into small highs that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI seek more and more of to the detriment of everything else.\n\t\t\t\t\tSo, if you're looking for me. I'm here, just not there."
