Mostly due to lots of meetings occuring. Of course, when people want a system to perform flawlessly, it rarely does so. While I have no ‚Äúreal‚Äù A/V experience, I can turn things on and off, or plug and unplug things. That makes me well suited for the IT industry.\n\t\t\t\t\tThis leads me to yesterday. A Very Important Meeting is going on and one of the screens connected has a weird flickering issue. Attempts to restart the display and the meeting fail to mete out results. So, I work my way down the chain. Behind this display is the HDMI connection, attached to this is an odd little ‚Äúinterposer‚Äù. Not knowing what this does, I removed it and plugged the cable directly into the display, which immediately clears up the issue. Problem solved.

HDMI is digital though. If the signal isn‚Äôt a 1 or a 0, then it‚Äôs not anything.

          "How I Build This Site\n\t\t\t\t\t\tüîó\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t10:38:47 on 2023-01-11\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWhen I set up this site, I was iterating on a site\n\t\t\t\t\tinfrastructure that I had done previously. A very simple\n\t\t\t\t\tsetup of using S3's 'static site' function to provide a\n\t\t\t\t\tfront-end to a bucket. I would then use DNS to point to the\n\t\t\t\t\tendpoint S3 static hostname. This worked well, for a time.\n\t\t\t\t\tHowever, this was not as fast as it could be. Mainly,\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause every request would hit the East Coast bucket\n\t\t\t\t\tendpoint every time. There were no closer endpoints unless\n\t\t\t\t\tyou manually set up another bucket with static site hosting\n\t\t\t\t\tin a different region. Boo üëé.\n\t\t\t\t\tCloudFront\n\t\t\t\t\tAmazon, of course, has a solution for this. Allow their\n\t\t\t\t\tcaching front end CloudFront to handle the requests. This\n\t\t\t\t\twill put your content into geographically closer endpoints\n\t\t\t\t\ton their network. If the content isn't already there, it‚Äôll\n\t\t\t\t\tbe fetched from the source bucket automatically. Not only\n\t\t\t\t\tdoes this make connectivity faster for your users, but\n\t\t\t\t\tallows you to have only one end point where your source\n\t\t\t\t\tfiles are. Each distribution point getting updated as\n\t\t\t\t\tneeded.\n\t\t\t\t\tBuilding\n\t\t\t\t\tMaking this all work with minimal hassle took some time\n\t\t\t\t\tto figure out how things work in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAWS. It's not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfully\n\t\t\t\t\t\tautomated, either. It‚Äôs comfortably, for me, automated\n\t\t\t\t\t\tso that the important parts that take the most time to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdo are done easily. It‚Äôs also flexible enough that you\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcould substitute in a different system that you'd prefer\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto use (like Azure or Netlify or whatever).\n\t\t\t\t\t0. Content\n\t\t\t\t\tI presume that you have some content you‚Äôd like to\n\t\t\t\t\tpublish. Be it a Single Page App, or a blog generated with\n\t\t\t\t\tone of those Static Site Generators. It could even be a\n\t\t\t\t\tsingle page blog like mine. It doesn't really matter. You\n\t\t\t\t\thave a folder full of stuff you‚Äôd like to host.\n\t\t\t\t\tI save mine in GitHub, so this prerequisite is to have\n\t\t\t\t\tGit available. Again, your choice. You can have content from\n\t\t\t\t\twhere ever, even on something like DropBox. Whatever works\n\t\t\t\t\tfor you\n\t\t\t\t\t1. Location\n\t\t\t\t\tI set up my site on AWS, so I‚Äôll be talking about that.\n\t\t\t\t\tMy system involves a single bucket where CloudFront is going\n\t\t\t\t\tto be getting its data from. I don't do anything special to\n\t\t\t\t\tthis bucket. Actually, that's not entirely true.\n\t\t\t\t\tLater, I set up a user with permissions to access this\n\t\t\t\t\tbucket, but I've not set the public access or static site\n\t\t\t\t\tpermissions on the bucket. Mostly, I've left it as-is. You\n\t\t\t\t\tcan feel free to upload the content at this point.\n\t\t\t\t\t2. Caching\n\t\t\t\t\tCloudFront is next. Setting up a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdistribution is fairly straight-forward. You‚Äôll\n\t\t\t\t\t\twant to choose the endpoints that matter to you. I‚Äôve\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchosen North America and Europe. While I‚Äôm sure there\n\t\t\t\t\t\tare folks who would like to read my blog from elsewhere\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the world. I‚Äôm not sure if it matters much. You can\n\t\t\t\t\t\tleave this option on \"Use all edge locations\". You will\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe paying slightly more per request, but it likely\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdoesn‚Äôt even matter unless you‚Äôre dealing with millions\n\t\t\t\t\t\tor billions of requests.\n\t\t\t\t\tYou can also set up the names you want the site to\n\t\t\t\t\trespond to. Make sure that you have any subdomains that you\n\t\t\t\t\twant to respond, as well. Things like www. is a\n\t\t\t\t\tsubdomain that people forget. You can add it later, but it\n\t\t\t\t\tmight mess up your certificate generation in the next\n\t\t\t\t\tpart.\n\t\t\t\t\tIf you want an SSL-secured site, then you can have Amazon\n\t\t\t\t\tgenerate you a certificate automatically. I did, it‚Äôs cheap\n\t\t\t\t\tand simple and since I also use Route 53, it‚Äôs automatically\n\t\t\t\t\tsetup and verified for me. If you have your own certificate,\n\t\t\t\t\tyou can upload it from here, too.\n\t\t\t\t\tAnother bit of automation is that you can set up an OAI\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor exclusive access from CloudFront to the source\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbucket. While this requires a bit of juggling with the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsole (copy the rules from the distribution into the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tS3 bucket policies), it‚Äôs worth it. This means that you\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdon‚Äôt have to expose the bucket to the world. Only\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCloudFront.\n\t\t\t\t\tOn Redirection\n\t\t\t\t\tAs an aside, there are methods to allow you to create URL\n\t\t\t\t\tredirects from within CloudFront. It‚Äôs not the easiest thing\n\t\t\t\t\tto implement, but it does work. Basically, you need to set\n\t\t\t\t\tup a CloudFront function that will be used to\n\t\t\t\t\tinspect the requests as they come in and redirect as needed.\n\t\t\t\t\tHere‚Äôs a sample of mine:\n\t\t\t\t\tfunction handler(event) {\n    const request = event.request;\n\n    switch (request.uri)\n    {\n        case request.uri.startsWith('/wishlist'):\n            // redirect to wishlist\n            return {\n                statusCode: 308,\n                statusDescription: 'Permanent Redirect',\n                headers: {\n                    \"location\": {\n                        \"value\": \"https://mywishlist.online/w/75dd8k/nathans-wishlist\"\n                    }\n                }\n            };\n    }\n\n    // Last resort, just return the URL\n    return request;\n}\n\t\t\t\t\tThis code looks at the request and makes a decision based\n\t\t\t\t\ton if the URL request starts with\n\t\t\t\t\t\t/wishlist. If it does, then redirect it to\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta new URL of my choice. You can get pretty crazy here,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut keep in mind that they will charge you extra\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdepending on how much time this code takes to\n\t\t\t\t\t\texecute.\n\t\t\t\t\t3. Glue\n\t\t\t\t\tFinally, I use a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMakefile to actually upload the files to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAWS, and then\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvalidate the current CloudFront cache. This\n\t\t\t\t\t\tensures that CloudFront endpoints have the latest\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontent available to it. Generally, this looks like two\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcommands to the awscli tool:\naws s3 sync . s3://your-bucket-name --quiet --exclude \".git**\" --exclude ...\naws cloudfront create-invalidation --distribution-id YOURCLOUDFRONTID --paths=/\\*\n\t\t\t\t\tFin\n\t\t\t\t\tThere's not a lot going on with the mechanics of the\n\t\t\t\t\tsite. Mostly it's just the setup of the infrastructure in\n\t\t\t\t\tAWS, first, then pushing the content up and making sure that\n\t\t\t\t\tthings are fresh for users.\n\t\t\t\t\tYou can\n\t\t\t\t\tsee the code I use on GitHub."

This system has evolved and\n\t\t\t\t\t   changed over its long history, as any piece of software\n\t\t\t\t\t   might. The flexibility of the X Window system shows that\n\t\t\t\t\t   even though it is old, it's still able to be quite modern.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tA series of articles (and live demos) written by Jasper St.\n\t\t\t\t\t      Pierre, goes into a high-level overview of how this amazing\n\t\t\t\t\t   system works, and continues to work, in the modern era.\n\t\t\t\t\t   While Wayland may be all the rage, some of us are still\n\t\t\t\t\t   living with this amazing historical piece of engineering."

Not that it was bad, just interesting. My parents, now fully\n\t\t\t\t\t   moved in down here, are involved. That makes an already split Christmas a bit more complex. In a\n\t\t\t\t\t   good way. We're all still trying to feel out how it's going to work going forward, but I can see\n\t\t\t\t\t   things should go well.\n\t\t\t\t\tWork is very, very slow. It's one of the reasons I started re-using my Mastodon account. Using my\n\t\t\t\t\t   Mastodon account made me realize that I really just can't handle it. So I closed it.\n\t\t\t\t\tThankfully, I have a Switch and, now, a Steam deck to occupy my time. The deck is good enough for\n\t\t\t\t\t   me to completely remove Steam from my laptop, along with all the games and (mercifully) all the\n\t\t\t\t\t   i386 compatibility libraries that were taking up so much space. It's all a bit snappier.\n\t\t\t\t\tI'm not sure if I'll keep this write.as account much longer. It's expensive for what you get, but\n\t\t\t\t\t   it does have the convenience of just typing into a box and hitting publish, so there's that.\n\t\t\t\t\tHopefully you and yours had a good Christmas, or whatever holiday you participate in. The end of\n\t\t\t\t\t   the year is a good time to reflect and understand yourself better and celebrate each other. I\n\t\t\t\t\t   know I need to do more of that.\n\t\t\t\t\tMerry Christmas!"

          "More Emacs Archaeology: Input Methods\n\t\t\t\t\t\tüîó\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t18:52:52 on 2022-12-14\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tInput methods, or, the way you put in non-ASCII\n\t\t\t\t\tcharacters is likely not archaeology for\n\t\t\t\t\tmuch of the world, but it's something I don't know\n\t\t\t\t\tmuch about. Plus, I learned a couple of neat\n\t\t\t\t\ttricks. So \"archaeology\" it is.\n\t\t\t\t\tEmacs has a rather complete set of input\n\t\t\t\t\tmethods. Given that it was born and refined in the\n\t\t\t\t\tterminal days, where common non-ASCII input\n\t\t\t\t\tsystems were probably not the norm, it handles\n\t\t\t\t\tlots of different languages and keyboard layouts.\n\t\t\t\t\tHowever, there appear to be some useful layouts\n\t\t\t\t\tthat are more than mere \"input methods\":\n\t\t\t\t\tOne such method is the sgml input\n\t\t\t\t\tmethod (accessed by C-\\). This converts\n\t\t\t\t\tany proper HTML encoding sequence after\n\t\t\t\t\tan & character into the display\n\t\t\t\t\tequivalent. So characters\n\t\t\t\t\tlike ‚Ä¶ are turned into\n\t\t\t\t\tellipses, or ‚Ñ¢ is turned into\n\t\t\t\t\tthe Trademark logo. Pretty neat! You can do a\n\t\t\t\t\tsimilar thing for LaTeX documents with\n\t\t\t\t\tthe TeX input method.\n\t\t\t\t\tSo, you might have been thinking: \"Doesn't this\n\t\t\t\t\tkind of sit inside of the prettify-symbol\n\t\t\t\t\twheelhouse of replacing sequences of characters\n\t\t\t\t\twith a pretty glyph?\" Or perhaps you were\n\t\t\t\t\tthinking: \"Why not just setup some easy\n\t\t\t\t\tabbreviations with abbrev?\" For some of the more\n\t\t\t\t\tastute among my Emacs readers might also say:\n\t\t\t\t\t\"Hey! You can just press C-x 8 and\n\t\t\t\t\tinput pretty much any unicode symbol!\n\t\t\t\t\tWhat's the point of this?\".\n\t\t\t\t\tYou, of course, would be correct. There are\n\t\t\t\t\tlots of ways of handling this. Abbrevs and\n\t\t\t\t\tprettify symbol both do what you ask, one altering\n\t\t\t\t\tthe text and one not. And yes, you are right when\n\t\t\t\t\tyou say you could use the unicode insertion macro.\n\t\t\t\t\tAll true. However, as in input method, this\n\t\t\t\t\tfeature is easily toggled and in doing so\n\t\t\t\t\tallows you to continue writing, without having to\n\t\t\t\t\tbreak your stride too much. That said, I don't\n\t\t\t\t\tthink I'll have much of a place to use it in the\n\t\t\t\t\tfuture. I'm not writing documents anymore, and my\n\t\t\t\t\tcoding days are behind me. Maybe, one day, I'll\n\t\t\t\t\tneed it for something. On that day, I'll be glad\n\t\t\t\t\tI'm using Emacs."

These\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcollections, combined, are pretty formidable, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tare in generally very good condition. As it turns\n\t\t\t\t\t\tout, also worth a decent chunk of change. While\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnot life-altering, they amount to enough\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto have to report to the IRS as earned income.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhich is hilarious.\n\t\t\t\t\tIt's nice to see that collectors of fine old\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNintendo games are still around, looking for nice\n\t\t\t\t\t\tadditions to their collections. While not\n\t\t\t\t\t\teverything is an amazing seller, the ones that\n\t\t\t\t\t\thave sold well surprised me. Games like\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGhostbusters; Which I never could get the hang of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas a kid, and Metroid, which confused me. Both did\n\t\t\t\t\t\twell.\n\t\t\t\t\tI also discovered some games that I didn't\n\t\t\t\t\t\trealize existed, things like stand-alone Duck Hunt\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand Super Mario Bros being chief among them. While\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI guess I shouldn't be surprised that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthere were stand alone versions of these games, I\n\t\t\t\t\t\tguess I was just familiar with the more common\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcombo versions of the games. It's been one\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprofitable nostalgia trip.\n\t\t\t\t\tI've also learned a bit about how eBay\n\t\t\t\t\t\toperates, and how they make their money.

There are\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlots of tools to allow you to extend Emacs in ways\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat were likely never imagined when it was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcreated (checks notes‚Ä¶ 46\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tyears ago). Some of these are\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttremendously useful, worthy of inclusion into\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEmacs proper. Some are just utilities to make a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tparticular task easier or smooth over a rough\n\t\t\t\t\t\tedge.\n\t\t\t\t\tI, however, I don't use many of those things. I\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdon't program anymore, and many of those utility\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpackages just sort of paper over some\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfunctionality that I could likely just figure out\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton my own, or eschew altogether. To that end, I've\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen stripping out parts of my Emacs configuration\n\t\t\t\t\t\tor rewriting it to not require things\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlike use-package or writing more\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfunctions that do similar functionality. One big\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthing is investigating the inner workings of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcore distribution of Emacs. Just like I've been\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdoing some archaeology in previous posts, I've\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen putting some of the things I've discovered to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tuse. Things like configuring ibuffer\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto have custom categories, or\n\t\t\t\t\t\tattaching hl-line to make\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnavigating dired-like buffers easier\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinstead of using something like lin.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIt's been a journey, and a learning experience,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut I think I'm more in tune with how to use Emacs\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmore effectively, even with those\n\t\t\t\t\t\tenhancements."

I guess this is a \"shame on\n\t\t\t\t\t\tme\" moment.\n\t\t\t\t\tNot 3 years ago, Aral was talking\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tabout how their iOS ad-blocking app \"Better Blocker\" was doing\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmiddling-ly well, but gave them a decent chunk of change a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyear (more than some make doing actual jobs). Now,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbecause Apple didn't fight doing searches for child pornography\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton people's photos, they've taken it down.\n\t\t\t\t\tMind you, Better Blocker was a paid application. One\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat required only maintenance to stay in line with the app\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstore rules and to throw up block list updates on some external\n\t\t\t\t\t\tserver. Not exactly rocket science. When they took down their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tapp, they didn't even bother to tell paid users. It just stops\n\t\t\t\t\t\tupdating. The app page is unavailable and there is nothing but a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tblog post on his personal site about it. Wonderful.\n\t\t\t\t\tWhat a pretentious douchebag. If you want to steer clear of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnon-profits doing more harm than good, then stay away from the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tso-called \"Small Technology Foundation\". Nothing good comes from\n\t\t\t\t\t\teither of these two grifters using the guise of non-profit to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlive a privileged life..\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tüîó Permalink to this post."
