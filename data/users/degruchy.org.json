Some of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit's old Comic Books, some are various collections\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof old cards, some are just toys and do-dads.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHowever, it seems as though I had quite\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe collection of Nintendo (NES) Games.\n\t\t\t\t\tAdditionally, my wife's parent's also\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsaved their NES stuff from 30 years ago. These\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcollections, combined, are pretty formidable, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tare in generally very good condition. As it turns\n\t\t\t\t\t\tout, also worth a decent chunk of change. While\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnot life-altering, they amount to enough\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto have to report to the IRS as earned income.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhich is hilarious.\n\t\t\t\t\tIt's nice to see that collectors of fine old\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNintendo games are still around, looking for nice\n\t\t\t\t\t\tadditions to their collections. While not\n\t\t\t\t\t\teverything is an amazing seller, the ones that\n\t\t\t\t\t\thave sold well surprised me. Games like\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGhostbusters; Which I never could get the hang of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas a kid, and Metroid, which confused me. Both did\n\t\t\t\t\t\twell.\n\t\t\t\t\tI also discovered some games that I didn't\n\t\t\t\t\t\trealize existed, things like stand-alone Duck Hunt\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand Super Mario Bros being chief among them. While\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI guess I shouldn't be surprised that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthere were stand alone versions of these games, I\n\t\t\t\t\t\tguess I was just familiar with the more common\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcombo versions of the games. It's been one\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprofitable nostalgia trip.\n\t\t\t\t\tI've also learned a bit about how eBay\n\t\t\t\t\t\toperates, and how they make their money. It's a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpretty neat idea, one I'm surprised didn't take\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlonger to catch on."

There are\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlots of tools to allow you to extend Emacs in ways\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat were likely never imagined when it was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcreated (checks notesâ€¦ 46\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tyears ago). Some of these are\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttremendously useful, worthy of inclusion into\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEmacs proper. Some are just utilities to make a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tparticular task easier or smooth over a rough\n\t\t\t\t\t\tedge.\n\t\t\t\t\tI, however, I don't use many of those things. I\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdon't program anymore, and many of those utility\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpackages just sort of paper over some\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfunctionality that I could likely just figure out\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton my own, or eschew altogether. To that end, I've\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen stripping out parts of my Emacs configuration\n\t\t\t\t\t\tor rewriting it to not require things\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlike use-package or writing more\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfunctions that do similar functionality. One big\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthing is investigating the inner workings of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcore distribution of Emacs. Just like I've been\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdoing some archaeology in previous posts, I've\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen putting some of the things I've discovered to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tuse.

At various points in my past, I was\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttrying to map my blog onto the mechanisms that run\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat system, as well as be a good \"IndieWeb\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcitizen. Back then, I was using tooling that\n\t\t\t\t\t\twasn't quite there yet. Trying to map tooling like\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWordPress into paradigms that it wasn't really\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdesigned (at the core) to handle seems to be the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfavorite past-time of web-developers. I also was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlooking at dedicated platforms, like micro.blog\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand Known. Those are good in their own right. Just\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnot for me.\n\t\t\t\t\tToday I came across a couple more dedicated\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpackages for being both personal microblog\n\t\t\t\t\t\tservices, and good IndieWeb citizens.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMicroblog.pub and Akkoma. Great ideas for ensuring\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat your content hits the widest community it\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcan, and provides nice feedback and other \"cool\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsocial\" stuff, like \"likes, favorites and\n\t\t\t\t\t\treblogs\". It's really a tempting time to spin up\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsomething and see if things have improved over the\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttime I've been absent from the space.\n\t\t\t\t\tThat's the thing, though. I don't need\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthose things. I don't want the hassle of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmanaging postgres, or python, or elixr or any of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe other components required to bundle something\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat I likely won't get any use out of anyway. I\n\t\t\t\t\t\talready know that no one will use it,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat I won't like managing it and that it'll all\n\t\t\t\t\t\tend in frustration. I'm trying not to be that guy\n\t\t\t\t\t\tanymore. I just want to slam some text into a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdocument and save it. Until I find some growing\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpain that I can't fix, this is all I need."
