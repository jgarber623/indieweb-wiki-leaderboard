          "Untitled(1)\n\t\t\t\t\t\tðŸ”—\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t16:20:14 on 2022-10-26\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBeen doing a bunch of stuff around the house,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand for school. Emacs has been a constant source\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof tinkering that I can do in between sessions of\n\t\t\t\t\t\twork. Not to mention that I can write my papers in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit, too. Double-win! Aside from that, I'm just\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttrying to work with my wife to get my parents into\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe established \"groove\" down here. So far so\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgood, but there is more to work on.\n\t\t\t\t\tSchool has been a big shit-show of admins not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeing able to create an online class for my\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCapstone, not having a professor for the first day\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof class and generally just fucking up everything\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat can be fucked up. I'm so checked out that I'm\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprobably better off just asking them to refund my\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmoney. Not that helps me get closer\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto actually graduating. Sigh.\n\t\t\t\t\tI'm exhausted, from trying to lose weight,\n\t\t\t\t\t\texercising in my company's gym, to just trying to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tkeep up with everything going on in the world. I\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfind myself low on empathy and high on burn out.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIt would be nice if I could just take a couple of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdays to nap or get shit straightened out with my\n\t\t\t\t\t\thealth and/or school. I don't see that one coming\n\t\t\t\t\t\tanytime soon, though."

Story of my life.\n\t\t\t\t\tI spent nearly ten years working on websites and doing\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"coding\" (for whatever values of that you're willing to\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccept for writing \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPHP). This was a position I inherited\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbecause I had tinkered with it as a kid and had an affinity\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor it. I was far from being a professional.\n\t\t\t\t\tI often have to remind myself that I am not:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tA developer\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAn artist or creative type\n\t\t\t\t\t\tA systems engineer\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tI have an expertise in doing desktop support. That's\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpretty much it. Everything else is just me learning enough\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto be, as Kev puts: \"dangerous\". I sometimes think that\n\t\t\t\t\t\teveryone behaves this way, and no one is an expert. However,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat is clearly not the case. People may not know every\n\t\t\t\t\t\taspect of a thing they have expertise in. However, for all\n\t\t\t\t\t\tintents and purposes, they're an 'expert'. I just wish I\n\t\t\t\t\t\tknew where the line was.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tðŸ”— Permalink to this post."

I don't even know why I bother with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tanything Aral has to say. He's such a blowhard, spinning up\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprojects that he has no intention of finishing, or even\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsupporting once he becomes bored. I guess this is a \"shame on\n\t\t\t\t\t\tme\" moment.\n\t\t\t\t\tNot 3 years ago, Aral was talking\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tabout how their iOS ad-blocking app \"Better Blocker\" was doing\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmiddling-ly well, but gave them a decent chunk of change a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyear (more than some make doing actual jobs). Now,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbecause Apple didn't fight doing searches for child pornography\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton people's photos, they've taken it down.\n\t\t\t\t\tMind you, Better Blocker was a paid application. One\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat required only maintenance to stay in line with the app\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstore rules and to throw up block list updates on some external\n\t\t\t\t\t\tserver. Not exactly rocket science. When they took down their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tapp, they didn't even bother to tell paid users. It just stops\n\t\t\t\t\t\tupdating. The app page is unavailable and there is nothing but a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tblog post on his personal site about it. Wonderful.\n\t\t\t\t\tWhat a pretentious douchebag. If you want to steer clear of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnon-profits doing more harm than good, then stay away from the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tso-called \"Small Technology Foundation\". Nothing good comes from\n\t\t\t\t\t\teither of these two grifters using the guise of non-profit to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlive a privileged life..\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tðŸ”— Permalink to this post."
