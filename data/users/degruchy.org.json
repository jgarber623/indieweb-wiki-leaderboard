Emacs has been a constant source\n\t\t\t\t\tof tinkering that I can do inbetween sessions of\n\t\t\t\t\twork. Not to mention that I can write my papers in\n\t\t\t\t\tit, too. Double-win! Aside from that, I'm just\n\t\t\t\t\ttrying to work with my wife to get my parents into\n\t\t\t\t\tthe established \"groove\" down here. So far so\n\t\t\t\t\tgood, but there is more to work on.\n\t\t\t\t\tSchool has been a big shit-show of admins not\n\t\t\t\t\tbeing able to create an online class for my\n\t\t\t\t\tCapstone, not having a professor for the first day\n\t\t\t\t\tof class and generally just fucking up everything\n\t\t\t\t\tthat can be fucked up. I'm so checked out that I'm\n\t\t\t\t\tprobably better off just asking them to refund my\n\t\t\t\t\tmoney. Not that helps me get closer\n\t\t\t\t\tto actually graduating. Sigh.\n\t\t\t\t\tI'm exhausted, from trying to lose weight,\n\t\t\t\t\texercising in my company's gym, to just trying to\n\t\t\t\t\tkeep up with everything going on in the world. I\n\t\t\t\t\tfind myself low on empathy and high on burn out.\n\t\t\t\t\tIt would be nice if I could just take a couple of\n\t\t\t\t\tdays to nap or get shit straightend out with my\n\t\t\t\t\thealth and/or school. I don't see that one coming\n\t\t\t\t\tanytime soon, though."

          "Downscaling my Emacs Package Usage\n\t\t\t\t\t\tðŸ”—\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t20:25:47 on 2022-10-19\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEmacs packages are all well good. There are\n\t\t\t\t\tlots of tools to allow you to extend Emacs in ways\n\t\t\t\t\tthat were likely never imagined when it was\n\t\t\t\t\tcreated (checks notesâ€¦ 46\n\t\t\t\t\tyears ago). Some of these are\n\t\t\t\t\ttremendously useful, worthy of inclusion into\n\t\t\t\t\tEmacs proper. Some are just utilities to make a\n\t\t\t\t\tparticular task easier or smooth over a rough\n\t\t\t\t\tedge.\n\t\t\t\t\tI, however, I don't use many of those things. I\n\t\t\t\t\tdon't program anymore, and many of those utility\n\t\t\t\t\tpackages just sort of paper over some\n\t\t\t\t\tfunctionality that I could likely just figure out\n\t\t\t\t\ton my own, or eschew altogether. To that end, I've\n\t\t\t\t\tbeen stripping out parts of my Emacs configuration\n\t\t\t\t\tor rewriting it to not require things\n\t\t\t\t\tlike use-package or writing more\n\t\t\t\t\tfunctions that do similar functionality. One big\n\t\t\t\t\tthing is investigating the inner workings of the\n\t\t\t\t\tcore distribution of Emacs. Just like I've been\n\t\t\t\t\tdoing some archaeology in previous posts, I've\n\t\t\t\t\tbeen putting some of the things I've discovered to\n\t\t\t\t\tuse. Things like configuring ibuffer\n\t\t\t\t\tto have custom categories, or\n\t\t\t\t\tattaching hl-line to make\n\t\t\t\t\tnavigating dired-like buffers easier\n\t\t\t\t\tinstead of using something like lin.\n\t\t\t\t\tIt's been a journey, and a learning experience,\n\t\t\t\t\tbut I think I'm more in tune with how to use Emacs\n\t\t\t\t\tmore effectively, even with those\n\t\t\t\t\tenhancements."

At various points in my past, I was\n\t\t\t\t\ttrying to map my blog onto the mechanisms that run\n\t\t\t\t\tthat system, as well as be a good \"IndieWeb\"\n\t\t\t\t\tcitizen. Back then, I was using tooling that\n\t\t\t\t\twasn't quite there yet. Trying to map tooling like\n\t\t\t\t\tWordPress into paradigms that it wasn't really\n\t\t\t\t\tdesiged (at the core) to handle seems to be the\n\t\t\t\t\tfavorite past-time of web-developers. I also was\n\t\t\t\t\tlooking at dedicated platforms, like micro.blog\n\t\t\t\t\tand Known. Those are good in their own right. Just\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnot for me.\n\t\t\t\t\tToday I came across a couple more dedicated\n\t\t\t\t\tpackages for being both personal microblog\n\t\t\t\t\tservices, and good IndieWeb citizens.\n\t\t\t\t\tMicroblog.pub and Akkoma. Great ideas for ensuring\n\t\t\t\t\tthat your content hits the widest community it\n\t\t\t\t\tcan, and provides nice feedback and other \"cool\n\t\t\t\t\tsocial\" stuff, like \"likes, favorites and\n\t\t\t\t\treblogs\". It's really a tempting time to spin up\n\t\t\t\t\tsomething and see if things have improved over the\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttime I've been absent from the space.\n\t\t\t\t\tThat's the thing, though.

I\n\t\t\t\t\talready know that no one will use it,\n\t\t\t\t\tthat I won't like managing it and that it'll all\n\t\t\t\t\tend in frustration. I'm trying not to be that guy\n\t\t\t\t\tanymore. I just want to slam some text into a\n\t\t\t\t\tdocument and save it. Until I find some growing\n\t\t\t\t\tpain that I can't fix, this is all I need."
