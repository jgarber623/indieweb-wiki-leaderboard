(It's a name I made up.)\nThis site is still in active development and I've been using it and building it at the same time, but you can learn more about me, read some of my writing, or check out my random thoughts.\nMost of my open-source work is on GitHub and my most-used social media platform is Twitter, but I've been trying to wean myself off of it.\n\n  \n\nEphemera Articles\n      About\n    Mastodon\n      Twitter\n      GitHub\n      Instagram\n  Except where otherwise noted, everything by cuibonobo on this website is\n    dedicated to the public domain."
