It’s a good recap of how I felt in deciding to walk away from work and dear friends at the end of 2018.\n\n\n\nAs I unplug from XWP, I’m reminded of the many amazing people I’ve met and worked with over the last almost three years.  The best way I can explain how I feel is via a Dave Matthews Band video:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you keep your eye on Carter Beauford (the drummer), you’ll see him watching and enjoying how others in the band are improvising all while still jamming to the song together.  He’s also keeping the rhythm going as others diverge from the “normal” arc of the song and not missing a beat in the process (pun intended for you punsters out there).  You can start to see a lot of this happening around and after the 3m20s mark as Carter plays under the horn section while the trumpet and sax play what comes to them.\n\n\n\nThis is exactly how I’ve felt working at XWP; namely that I’ve had the fortune to watch amazing people showcase their individual talents all while I merely “kept the beat going” alongside and underneath everyone else’s work.  I have had the privilege to be the face to our clients for this amazing work and I wish you all the very best in the future.  Please do stay in touch!"
