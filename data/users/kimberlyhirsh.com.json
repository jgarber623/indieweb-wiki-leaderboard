Real-time motion capture. Trying to create interaction between artist and fans.\r\nKey takeaways: new ways for fans to connect, artists found new ways to interact. \"What is the impact of the fan persona?\"\r\n\r\nEva Liu:  Talking about how stage musicals in China are thriving while Broadway is not - uses the closing of Phantom of the Opera on Broadway as an example.\r\nFirst key to success is the introduction of the immersive theater genre. Special environments and audience participation.\r\nImmersive theater's smaller audience size is good during pandemic\r\n2nd key: Embracing idol fandom. Free drawing for idol performer cards. Exploiting fan labor for marketing.\r\nFan-made souvenirs, fan photography.\r\nKey #3: Let's queer the theatres. All-male cast, cross-dressing, queer-baiting. These all appeal to female gaze. ([@KimberlyHirsh](https://micro.blog/KimberlyHirsh): How is Takarazuka doing? Could be a cool transnational study.)\r\n\"the pleasure obtained from face-to-face interaction is irreplaceable\"\r\nAll previous Eva Liu tweets are from @EvaLiu1996\r\n\r\nOlivia Johnston-Riley:  “Podficcing in the Pandemic” Key terms: Accessibility, Identity, Experience, Creating, Consuming, Socializing\r\nPodfic is fanfiction recorded aloud and shared as audiopods online. Some people never thought of it as accessible while other people, esp with print disability, used it. ([@KimberlyHirsh](https://micro.blog/KimberlyHirsh): like fanfiction audiobooks)\r\nSome fans used time they would otherwise have gone out to socialize to record podfic. Others experienced trauma and/or just felt pandemic didn't give them more time to create.\r\nListening to human voices made people feel less alone, but people who lost their commute or had more other people at home listened to less podfic.\r\nPodfic community was an important social activity for some participants. \r\n\r\nQing Xiao:  “‘Are We Friends or Opponents?’ Fans’ Relationship Changes from Online To Offline” with Yuhang Zheng\r\nIn idol fans pre-COVID there was a hierarchy where offline fans were considered \"core fans\" and online fans were more peripheral, but as idols moved activities online during COVID-19, this dynamic changed.\r\nMore affordable to attend signings, don't have to navigate physical distance\r\nChange of fan space made it more equitable, less hierarchical. Will the old patterns resurface? How do these patterns work in fandoms surrounding fictional works/characters?\r\n\r\n Julian Hofmann:  with Dina Rasolofoarison:  “Where Is roundtables Fandom Acted Out in 2022? An Update on Places of Fan Practices”\r\ninclusive definition of fandom - not just cult media, but specific nations/cultures, cooking, and more\r\n2 dimensions of places: 1. places have functions, 2. places of substitute consumption - driven by restrictions of time, money, or place\r\n\r\nDr. Kimberly Hirsh at #FSNNA22:  There's lots of great conversation happening in this session but I got distracted and am a little overwhelmed, sorry.\r\n\r\nEva Liu:  Eva talked about my question about Takarazuka, pointing out that while Takarazuka (Japanese all-women musical theater) has a strict division between otokoyaku (performers who always play men) and musumeyaku (performers who always play women) 1/2\r\n...Chinese and South Korean immersive theaters that feature all-male casts might have a performer play a man in one production and a woman in another.\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\t\n\t  → 10:17 AM, Oct 13\n\t\n  \n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\n  \n\tEven in Gather, I’m that nerd sitting in the front row. #FSNNA22\n\n  \n  \n\t\n\t  → 9:49 AM, Oct 13\n\t\n  \n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n  \n    RSS\n    JSON Feed\n    Micro.blog\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n IndieWebCamp \n  \n\n← An IndieWeb Webring  →\n\n  This work is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 . \n\n\nI acknowledge that I live and work on unceded Lumbee, Skaruhreh/Tuscarora, and Shakori land.

We are indebted to their labor and their sacrifice, and we must acknowledge the tremors of that violence throughout the generations and the resulting impact that can still be felt and witnessed today.

I give respect and reverence to those who came before me. I thank Holisticism for the text of this land acknowledgement.\nWe must acknowledge that much of what we know of this country today, including its culture, economic growth, and development throughout history and across time, has been made possible by the labor of enslaved Africans and their ascendants who suffered the horror of the transatlantic trafficking of their people, chattel slavery, and Jim Crow. We are indebted to their labor and their sacrifice, and we must acknowledge the tremors of that violence throughout the generations and the resulting impact that can still be felt and witnessed today. I thank Dr. Terah ‘TJ’ Stewart for the text of this labor acknowledgement."
