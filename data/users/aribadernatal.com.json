I joined Minerva as Employee #1 in 2012, and spent 7 years creating new tools to support learning and teaching, including Minerva's first Active Learning Forum, tools for formative assessment, and collaborative curriculum authoring system.\n\n\n\n Sketchpad logo \nIn 2010, I built Studio Sketchpad, a place for creative coders to collaboratively create interactive animations in Processing (and later P5.js.) In addition to serving as a venue for informal learning, Sketchpad has been used by 100+ universities, high schools, and coding workshops.
