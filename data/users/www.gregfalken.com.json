They should be words that let you challenge yourself as to motives and decisions. They should be words that help you guide your actions.</p>\n<p>The idea behind there being three words (and not five or seven or one) is that you can create a kind of “triangulation” between three words, such that they can stand alone and work together.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Sharing your three words gives them a little added impact and hopefully stimulates some discussion. Here are mine. I add a few words of explanation to them, so I don’t forget what I was thinking when I picked them.</p>\n<h2>Sufficiency</h2>\n<p>How much is enough? Where are my resources?
