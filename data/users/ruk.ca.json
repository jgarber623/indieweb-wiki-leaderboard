We talk. <em>A lot.</em> About our relationship. About how we’re feeling. About how we’re feeling about how we’re feeling. We chart and conspire and conjure.

She was worried about going to her day program, lapsing into the illness she’s just kicked, and being paralyzed by her inability to communicate this to her support workers. Knowing that, we texted her workers to let them know about this fear, and that she might need to rest and take breaks through the day.</p>\n\n<p>Olivia calmed down. I calmed down. The morning proceeded smoothly for both of us.</p>\n\n<p>I could have stayed below the line, railed against my circumstances, stayed in a funk, fought with Olivia. But I didn’t, and it was only by following my curiosity that I was able to get there.</p>\n\n<p>It turns out that coupling with someone with a strong inner game is a good starting point for strengthening my own inner game, an inner game that circumstances have asked a lot of in recent years, an inner game that’s been pummelled from many sides and that needed some new colours.</p>\n\n<p>I come from a school of Generation X upper-middle-class white men who were raised to think rather than feel, to play the hand we were dealt, to power through adversity, to confront difficult situations by simply saying “well, he’s an idiot, so there’s no point in dealing with him.” The notion that there was a thing called “personal development,” that we could grow our game, get better at things by looking inside, that was tantamount to woo woo sorcery. I’m fortunate that adversity has loaned me the capability to see beyond those limitations: I’ve learned to seek help, from counsellors, coaches, friends, neighbours, strangers. I’ve learned that thing that Lisa calls the “inner game” is malleable, capable of evolving.</p>\n\n<p>So, <a href=\"http://chandlercoaches.com/coach-to-thrive/\">Coach to Thrive</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I’ve been privileged to watch Lisa and her coaching partner Julie Ann develop this new program from the ground up, distilling what they’ve learned about taking a “coach-like” approach to leadership into a compact, focused two-day workshop for leaders in business, government, and non-profits. </p>\n\n<p>It feels weird to write “hey, you should go to my girlfriend’s leadership workshop,” as I am anything but an unbiased actor.
