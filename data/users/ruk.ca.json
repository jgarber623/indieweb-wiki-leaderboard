The reading lamp, for reasons unknown, maintained a temperature of 500 degrees, and was most unappealing to be near.\n\nAnd while all those things were true, ultimately the problem I was trying to solve—doing something to make myself feel more at home in this house—was a larger project needing broader solutions, not all of them related to paint and furniture.\n\nThis became moot a few years later when the room evolved to become a storage closet for our mountains of stuff, and then, a few years after that, when Catherine moved into the room during her cancer treatment. The red-orange-red that was supposed to calm me became a conversation starter and aesthetic irritant to all who encountered it.\n\nHere’s what the room looks like this morning:\n\n The same room, now painted white, with blue cupboards. \n\nDon and Derek from Colonial Painters were in this week for a second round of painting—they painted the lower floor and the upstairs hallway this summer—and the result is a room transformed. \n\nPaint is powerful.\nPaintingColonial PaintingHellOrangeRedWhiteBlue"
