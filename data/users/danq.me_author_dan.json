Sure, it still won every game, but it was a blunt instrument, and anybody who’s seriously thought about games like this can tell you why. You know how when you play e.g. <em>Wordle</em> (but not in “hard mode”) you sometimes want to type in a word that <em>can’t possibly be the solution</em> because it’s the best way to rule in (or out) certain key letters? This kind of strategic search space bisection reduces the mean number of guesses you need to solve the puzzle, and the same’s true in <em>Mastermind</em>. But because my solver will only propose guesses from the list of candidate solutions, it can’t make this kind of improvement.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_17291\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-17291\" style=\"width: 484px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://danq.me/2020/06/27/break-into-us/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"lazy lazy-hidden wp-image-17291 size-full\" src=\"https://danq.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/xsearch-scope-demo-30x19.gif.pagespeed.ic.Ko3knda-4C.png\" data-lazy-type=\"image\" data-lazy-src=\"https://danq.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/search-scope-demo.gif\" alt='Animation showing how three clues alone are sufficient to derive a unique answer from the search space of the original \"break into us\" lock puzzle.' width=\"484\" height=\"304\"><noscript><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-17291 size-full\" src=\"https://danq.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/search-scope-demo.gif\" alt='Animation showing how three clues alone are sufficient to derive a unique answer from the search space of the original \"break into us\" lock puzzle.' width=\"484\" height=\"304\"></noscript></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-17291\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">My blog post about <a href=\"https://danq.me/2020/06/27/break-into-us/\"><em>Break Into Us</em></a> used a series of visual metaphors to show search space dissection, including this one.

Or it’s because we’re “Super” Mastermind, which differs from the one I had as a child in that eight (not six) peg colours are available and secret codes are permitted to have duplicate peg colours. These changes increase the possible permutations from 360 to 4,096, but the number of guesses allowed only goes up from 8 to 10. That’s hard.\n A plastic Mastermind board in brown and green; it has twelve spots for guessing and shows six coloured pegs. The game has been won on the sixth guess.

See for example my efforts to determine the hardest hangman words and make an adverserial hangman game, to generate solvable puzzles for my lock puzzle game, to cheat at online jigsaws, or to balance my D&D-themed Wordle clone.\nHey, that’s an idea. Let’s crack the code… by writing some code!\n Screenshot showing Mastermind game from WebGamesOnline.com. Seven guesses have been made, each using only one colour for each of the four pegs, and no guesses are corect; only red pegs have never been guessed.  Screenshot showing Mastermind game from WebGamesOnline.com. Seven guesses have been made, each using only one colour for each of the four pegs, and no guesses are corect; only red pegs have never been guessed. This online edition plays a lot like the version our kids play, although the peg colours are different. Next guess should be an easy solve!\nRepresenting a search space\nThe search space for Super Mastermind isn’t enormous, and it lends itself to some highly-efficient computerised storage.\nThere are 8 different colours of peg. We can express these colours as a number between 0 and 7, in three bits of binary, like this:\n\n\n\nDecimal\nBinary\nColour\n\n\n\n\n0\n000\nRed\n\n\n1\n001\nOrange\n\n\n2\n010\nYellow\n\n\n3\n011\nGreen\n\n\n4\n100\nBlue\n\n\n5\n101\nPink\n\n\n6\n110\nPurple\n\n\n7\n111\nWhite\n\n\n\nThere are four pegs in a row, so we can express any given combination of coloured pegs as a 12-bit binary number. E.g. 100 110 111 010 would represent the permutation blue (100), purple (110), white (111), yellow (010). The total search space, therefore, is the range of numbers from 000000000000 through 111111111111… that is: decimal 0 through 4,095:\n\n\n\nDecimal\nBinary\nColours\n\n\n\n\n0\n000000000000\nRed, red, red, red\n\n\n1\n000000000001\nRed, red, red, orange\n\n\n2\n000000000010\nRed, red, red, yellow\n\n\n…………\n\n\n4092\n111111111100\nWhite, white, white, blue\n\n\n4093\n111111111101\nWhite, white, white, pink\n\n\n4094\n111111111110\nWhite, white, white, purple\n\n\n4095\n111111111111\nWhite, white, white, white\n\n\n\nWhenever we make a guess, we get feedback in the form of two variables: each peg that is in the right place is a bull; each that represents a peg in the secret code but isn’t in the right place is a cow (the names come from Mastermind’s precursor, Bulls & Cows). Four bulls would be an immediate win (lucky!), any other combination of bulls and cows is still valuable information. Even a zero-score guess is valuable- potentially very valuable! – because it tells the player that none of the pegs they’ve guessed appear in the secret code.\n A plastic Mastermind board in blue and yellow with ten guess spaces and eight pegs. The sixth guess is unscored but looks likely to be the valid solution.  A plastic Mastermind board in blue and yellow with ten guess spaces and eight pegs. The sixth guess is unscored but looks likely to be the valid solution. If one of Wordle‘s parents was Scrabble, then this was the other. Just ask its Auntie Twitter.\nSolving with Javascript\nThe latest versions of Javascript support binary literals and bitwise operations, so we can encode and decode between arrays of four coloured pegs (numbers 0-7) and the number 0-4,095 representing the guess as shown below. Decoding uses an AND bitmask to filter to the requisite digits then divides by the order of magnitude. Encoding is just a reduce function that bitshift-concatenates the numbers together.\n\n\n\n\n\n116\r\n117\r\n118\r\n119\r\n120\r\n121\r\n122\r\n123\r\n124\r\n125\r\n126\r\n127\r\n128\r\n129\r\n130\r\n131\r\n132\r\n133\r\n134\n\n\n/**\r\n * Decode a candidate into four peg values by using binary bitwise operations.\r\n */\r\nfunction decodeCandidate(candidate){\r\n  return [\r\n    (candidate & 0b111000000000) / 0b001000000000,\r\n    (candidate & 0b000111000000) / 0b000001000000,\r\n    (candidate & 0b000000111000) / 0b000000001000,\r\n    (candidate & 0b000000000111) / 0b000000000001\r\n  ];\r\n}\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * Given an array of four integers (0-7) to represent the pegs, in order, returns a single-number\r\n * candidate representation.\r\n */\r\nfunction encodeCandidate(pegs) {\r\n  return pegs.reduce((a, b)=>(a << 3) + b);\r\n}\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith this, we can simply:\n\nProduce a list of candidate solutions (an array containing numbers 0 through 4,095).\nChoose one candidate, use it as a guess, and ask the code-maker how it scores.\nEliminate from the candidate solutions list all solutions that would not score the same number of bulls and cows for the guess that was made.\nRepeat from step #2 until you win.\n\nStep 3’s the most important one there. Given a function getScore( solution, guess ) which returns an array of [ bulls, cows ] a given guess would score if faced with a specific solution, that code would look like this (I’m convined there must be a more-performant way to eliminate candidates from the list with XOR bitmasks, but I haven’t worked out what it is yet):\n\n\n\n\n\n164\r\n165\r\n166\r\n167\r\n168\r\n169\r\n170\r\n171\r\n172\r\n173\r\n174\r\n175\r\n176\r\n177\r\n178\r\n179\r\n180\r\n181\r\n182\n\n\n/**\r\n * Given a guess (array of four integers from 0-7 to represent the pegs, in order) and the number\r\n * of bulls (number of pegs in the guess that are in the right place) and cows (number of pegs in the\r\n * guess that are correct but in the wrong place), eliminates from the candidates array all guesses\r\n * invalidated by this result. Return true if successful, false otherwise.\r\n */\r\nfunction eliminateCandidates(guess, bulls, cows){\r\n  const newCandidatesList = data.candidates.filter(candidate=>{\r\n    const score = getScore(candidate, guess);\r\n    return (score[0] == bulls) && (score[1] == cows);\r\n  });\r\n  if(newCandidatesList.length == 0) {\r\n    alert('That response would reduce the candidate list to zero.');\r\n    return false;\r\n  }\r\n  data.candidates = newCandidatesList;\r\n  chooseNextGuess();\r\n  return true;\r\n}\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI continued in this fashion to write a full solution (source code). It uses ReefJS for component rendering and state management, and you can try it for yourself right in your web browser. If you play against the online version I mentioned you’ll need to transpose the colours in your head: the physical version I play with the kids has pink and purple pegs, but the online one replaces these with brown and black.\nTesting the solution\nLet’s try it out against the online version:\n  \nAs expected, my code works well-enough to win the game every time I’ve tried, both against computerised and in-person opponents. So – unless you’ve been actively thinking about the specifics of the algorithm I’ve employed – it might surprise you to discover that… my solution is very-much a suboptimal one!\n A young boy sits cross-legged on the floor, grinning excitedly at a Mastermind board (from the code-maker's side).  A young boy sits cross-legged on the floor, grinning excitedly at a Mastermind board (from the code-maker's side). My code has only failed to win a single game… and that turned out to because my opponent, playing overexcitedly, cheated in the third turn. To be fair, my code didn’t lose either, though: it identified that a mistake must have been made and we declared the round void when we identified the problem.\nMy solution is suboptimal\nA couple of games in, the suboptimality of my solution became pretty visible. Sure, it still won every game, but it was a blunt instrument, and anybody who’s seriously thought about games like this can tell you why. You know how when you play e.g. Wordle (but not in “hard mode”) you sometimes want to type in a word that can’t possibly be the solution because it’s the best way to rule in (or out) certain key letters? This kind of strategic search space bisection reduces the mean number of guesses you need to solve the puzzle, and the same’s true in Mastermind. But because my solver will only propose guesses from the list of candidate solutions, it can’t make this kind of improvement.\n Animation showing how three clues alone are sufficient to derive a unique answer from the search space of the original \"break into us\" lock puzzle.  Animation showing how three clues alone are sufficient to derive a unique answer from the search space of the original \"break into us\" lock puzzle. My blog post about Break Into Us used a series of visual metaphors to show search space dissection, including this one. If you missed it, it might be worth reading.\nSearch space bisection is also used in my adverserial hangman game, but in this case the aim is to split the search space in such a way that no matter what guess a player makes, they always find themselves in the larger remaining portion of the search space, to maximise the number of guesses they have to make. Y’know, because it’s evil.\n Screenshot showing a single guess row from Online Mastermind, with the guess Red, Red, Green, Green.  Screenshot showing a single guess row from Online Mastermind, with the guess Red, Red, Green, Green. A great first guess, assuming you’re playing against a random code and your rules permit the code to have repeated colours, is a “1122” pattern.\nThere are mathematically-derived heuristics to optimise Mastermind strategy. The first of these came from none other than Donald Knuth (legend of computer science, mathematics, and pipe organs) back in 1977. His solution, published at probably the height of the game’s popularity in the amazingly-named Journal of Recreational Mathematics, guarantees a solution to the six-colour version of the game within five guesses. Ville [2013] solved an optimal solution for a seven-colour variant, but demonstrated how rapidly the tree of possible moves grows and the need for early pruning – even with powerful modern computers – to conserve memory. It’s a very enjoyable and readable paper.\nBut for my purposes, it’s unnecessary. My solver routinely wins within six, maybe seven guesses, and by nonchalantly glancing at my phone in-between my guesses I can now reliably guess our children’s codes quickly and easily. In the end, that’s what this was all about."

                "value": "This blog post is also available as a video. Would you prefer to watch/listen to me tell you about not being a “dog person”, but still loving one dog in particular?\nI am not a “dog person”. I’m probably more of a “cat person”.\n The Diamond Dogs, from My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic season 1, episode 19. A cartoon image shows three humanoid doglike creatures with gem-encrusted collars and gemstones in their pockets. They're facing off-screen, to the right.  The Diamond Dogs, from My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic season 1, episode 19. A cartoon image shows three humanoid doglike creatures with gem-encrusted collars and gemstones in their pockets. They're facing off-screen, to the right. To clarify: when I say “dog person”, I don’t mean “anthropomorphic dog”, like those characters from that weird episode of FiM I talked about back in 2018.\nMy mum has made pets of one or both of dogs or cats for most of her life. She puts the difference between the two in a way that really resonates for me. To paraphrase her:\nWhen you’re feeling down and you’ve had a shitty day and you just need to wallow in your despair for a little bit… a pet dog will try to cheer you up. It’ll jump up at you, bring you toys, suggest that you go for a walk, try to pull your focus away from your misery and bring a smile to your face. A cat, though, will just come and sit and be melancholy with you. Its demeanour just wordlessly says: “You’re feeling crap? Me too: I only slept 16 hours today. Let’s feel crap together.”\n A calico cat on a red ledge against the white outside wall of a building, shadowed by leaves, stares into the camera with a grumpy half-closed-eyes look.  A calico cat on a red ledge against the white outside wall of a building, shadowed by leaves, stares into the camera with a grumpy half-closed-eyes look. “I hate Mondays. Also any other day of the week with a ‘Y’ in it.”\nSo it surprised many when, earlier this year, our family was expanded with the addition of a puppy called Demmy. I guess we collectively figured that now we’d solved all the hard problems and the complexities of our work, volunteering, parenting, relationships, money etc. and our lives were completely simple, plain sailing, and stress-free, all of the time… that we now had the capacity to handle adding another tiny creature into our midst. Do you see the mistake in that logic? Maybe we should have, too.\n Ruth, in the background, watches on as a French Bulldog puppy jumps up at her two children, a girl and a boy, in a wood-floored hallway.  Ruth, in the background, watches on as a French Bulldog puppy jumps up at her two children, a girl and a boy, in a wood-floored hallway. The kids were, and continue to be, absolutely delighted, especially our eldest who’s been mad about dogs now for well over half her life.\nIt turns out that getting a puppy is a lot like having a toddler all over again. Your life adjusts around when they need to sleep, eat, and poop. You need to put time, effort, and thought into how to make and keep your house safe both for and from them. And, of course, they bring with them a black hole that eats disposable income.\n A French Bulldog puppy sound asleep on a doormat.  A French Bulldog puppy sound asleep on a doormat. Sure they’re cute when they’re asleep, but the rest of the time they’re probably destroying things, pooping, or both. #PuppyOrToddler?\nThey need to be supervised and entertained and educated (the latter of which may require some education yourself). They need to be socialised so they can interact nicely with others, learn the boundaries of their little world, and behave appropriately (even when they’re not on camera).\n A crowd of humans and their dogs watches as Dan uses his finger to lead Demmy the dog through an agility course. She's mid-way through leaping over a yellow pole suspended between two mini traffic cones.  A crowd of humans and their dogs watches as Dan uses his finger to lead Demmy the dog through an agility course. She's mid-way through leaping over a yellow pole suspended between two mini traffic cones. At the end of elementary “puppy school”, we tried some agility course obstacles. Jumps were a success, even for Demmy’s little legs, but she’d far rather hang out inside a tunnel than run through one.\nEven as they grow, their impact is significant. You need to think more-deeply about how, when and where you travel, work out who’s responsible for ensuring they’re walked (or carried!) and fed (not eaten!) and watched. You’ve got to keep them safe and healthy and stimulated. Thankfully they’re not as tiring to play with as children, but as with kids, the level of effort required is hard to anticipate until you have one.\n An 8-year-old girl in a flowery pink dress lies on her back in a meadow of long dry grass, laughing with her eyes closed. On her belly, Demmy lies, looking up towards the camera with her tongue hanging out.  An 8-year-old girl in a flowery pink dress lies on her back in a meadow of long dry grass, laughing with her eyes closed. On her belly, Demmy lies, looking up towards the camera with her tongue hanging out. Whether you’re a human pup or a canine pup, there’s fun to be had in leaping out of long grass to pounce one another.\nBut do you know what else they have in common with kids? You can’t help learning to love them.\nIt doesn’t matter what stupid thing they’re illicitly putting in their mouth, how many times you have to clean up after them, how frustrating it is that they can’t understand what you need from them in order to help them, or how much they whine about something that really isn’t that big a deal (again: #PuppyOrToddler?). It doesn’t even matter how much you’re “not a dog person”, whatever that means. They become part of your family, and you fall in love with them.\n Under bright blue skies and in a green field, Dan and Demmy stare into the camera. Dan's flushed from the heat and wearing a purple-and-rainbow \"WordPress Pride\" t-shirt; Demmy's tongue hangs low and she's clearly panting.

But: while I ocassionally resent the trouble she causes, I still love our dog."
