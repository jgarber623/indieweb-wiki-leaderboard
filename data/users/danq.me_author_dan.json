A soggy kilometre or so later we quickly discovered that this was going to be more-challenging than I’d anticipated. We quickly got bogged down in a flooded field and needed to double-back. With my socks already soaking wet and the dog in a similar condition, we found a different route that looped around the entire hill and through an alpaca farm (or were they llamas?), then we worked our way up the South face of the hill, over the summit, and down to the hashpoint. We got there at 11:00 UTC, took a quick look around and pulled the closest thing a dog can manage to a silly grin, and then hacked our way back (by road) to Piddington for the drive home and some dry clothes.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Tracklog\" class=\"mw-headline\">Tracklog</span></h2>\n<h3><span id=\"Entire_expedition\" class=\"mw-headline\">Entire expedition</span></h3>\n<p><img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-lazy-type=\"iframe\" data-lazy-src='&lt;iframe class=\"tracklog-map\" style=\"width: 100%;

Cherwell Council advertise a circular walk that seems to circle from the village (which looked like a good place to park) up to Muswell Hill, the summit of which is near the hashpoint.\nShe and I walked through Piddington, past the church, and up onto the path. A soggy kilometre or so later we quickly discovered that this was going to be more-challenging than I’d anticipated. We quickly got bogged down in a flooded field and needed to double-back. With my socks already soaking wet and the dog in a similar condition, we found a different route that looped around the entire hill and through an alpaca farm (or were they llamas?), then we worked our way up the South face of the hill, over the summit, and down to the hashpoint. We got there at 11:00 UTC, took a quick look around and pulled the closest thing a dog can manage to a silly grin, and then hacked our way back (by road) to Piddington for the drive home and some dry clothes.\nTracklog\nEntire expedition\n  ﻿\n\nDownload tracklog (GPX)\n\nWalking part only\n  ﻿\n\nDownload tracklog (GPX)\nFitness tracker stats\n\nPhoto\n Dan - a man with a beard, wearing a grey fleece with a white poppy attached - crouches alongside his French Bulldog in a green field under a blue sky with a few wispy clouds.

I hoped I might be able to slip away from work for a lunchtime cycle to claim it.</p>\n<p>But the gods of technology didn’t approve of my plan and turned my workday into a catastrophe of the kind that only a computer can, and the chance of taking a long lunch evaporated quickly. But fortune dealt me a second hand when the weather held off into the evening, and I instead opted for a post-dinner huckle in the dark out to this hashpoint.</p>\n<p>I set out around 18:30, South through Stanton Harcourt then North up the adorably-named Ducklington Road. It took some time to sight the somewhat-concealed bridleway around the hill of Cokethorpe School. And then, another challenge – navigating by OpenStreetMap I missed my turning and went straight through a farmyard, and had to carry my bike over a fence at the other end. Turns out the map is wrong and I later found a sign indicating the true course of the bridleway; <a title=\"My OpenStreetMap changeset, correcting the misplaced bridleway\" href=\"https://www.openstreetmap.org/changeset/https://www.openstreetmap.org/changeset/129776592\">I’ll get that corrected</a>.</p>\n<p>I abandoned my bike for the final 50 metres, trekking through the thick grass of an unmown meadow to the hashpoint and arriving around 19:00. No panoramic photo today it’s too dark – but you get a silly grin.</p>\n<p>Pleased with this fast expedition, I diverted on my route home to the <a href=\"https://www.theharcourtarms.com/\">Harcourt Arms</a> pub for a pint of their surprisingly-delicious seasonal guest ale, <a href=\"https://brewyork.co.uk/product/fairytale-of-brew-york-2022/\">Fairytale of Brew York</a>, which genuinely tastes like stollen. There, I wrote up this expedition report, but I’ll have to get home before I can extract my <abbr class=\"abbr\" title=\"GPS receiver\">GPSr</abbr>‘s tracklog.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Tracklog\"

I hoped I might be able to slip away from work for a lunchtime cycle to claim it.\nBut the gods of technology didn’t approve of my plan and turned my workday into a catastrophe of the kind that only a computer can, and the chance of taking a long lunch evaporated quickly. But fortune dealt me a second hand when the weather held off into the evening, and I instead opted for a post-dinner huckle in the dark out to this hashpoint.\nI set out around 18:30, South through Stanton Harcourt then North up the adorably-named Ducklington Road. It took some time to sight the somewhat-concealed bridleway around the hill of Cokethorpe School. And then, another challenge – navigating by OpenStreetMap I missed my turning and went straight through a farmyard, and had to carry my bike over a fence at the other end. Turns out the map is wrong and I later found a sign indicating the true course of the bridleway; I’ll get that corrected.\nI abandoned my bike for the final 50 metres, trekking through the thick grass of an unmown meadow to the hashpoint and arriving around 19:00. No panoramic photo today it’s too dark – but you get a silly grin.\nPleased with this fast expedition, I diverted on my route home to the Harcourt Arms pub for a pint of their surprisingly-delicious seasonal guest ale, Fairytale of Brew York, which genuinely tastes like stollen. There, I wrote up this expedition report, but I’ll have to get home before I can extract my GPSr‘s tracklog.\nTracklog\n Map showing a journey from Sutton, near Stanton Harcourt, along the B4449 then up the A415 past Cokethorpe School, then along a bridleway and into a field (where a chequered flag icon appears), then back to the centre of Stanton Harcourt (where a beer icon appears) before returning to the start point in Sutton.

I’m moderately familiar with Appleton – I have a regular cycle circuit that comes right through it! – but I’ve never been out to the cricket club and sports field, so I pointed the hashing hound in the right direction and let her lead the way.</p>\n<p>At first it looked like this was going to be a successful expedition: the needle on my <abbr class=\"abbr\" title=\"GPS receiver\">GPSr</abbr> pointed almost directly ahead as I walked up the lane towards <a href=\"https://www.appleton-eaton.org/amenities/sports-field/\">Appleton Sports Field</a>. But as I got closer, I realised to my disappointment that the hashpoint was going to be about 25 metres into the adjacant field, guarded by a trio of bullocks. At 15:00 I declared the expedition a failure. The doggo and I completed an exploration of the lane and had a look around the sports field, spotted a pair of muntjack deer ambling around, and then headed back home.</p>\n<p>I’ll be back in Appleton later today to buy a Christmas tree, so I’ll wave at the cattle as I go past, again.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Tracklog\" class=\"mw-headline\">Tracklog</span></h2>\n<p>My GPSr kept a tracklog; note that this was an “on the way” stopoff so the start and end point isn’t the same!</p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"lazy lazy-hidden aligncenter size-full wp-image-20876\" src=\"https://danq.me/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/x2022-12-02-51-1-hashpoint-mini-map-30x20.png.pagespeed.ic.8x6dEvbTEU.jpg\" data-lazy-type=\"image\" data-lazy-src=\"https://danq.me/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/2022-12-02-51-1-hashpoint-mini-map.png\" alt=\"Map showing a line heading into Appleton from the South-West, diverting up the lane towards the Sports Field, and then turning back and leaving by the same route.

I’m moderately familiar with Appleton – I have a regular cycle circuit that comes right through it! – but I’ve never been out to the cricket club and sports field, so I pointed the hashing hound in the right direction and let her lead the way.\nAt first it looked like this was going to be a successful expedition: the needle on my GPSr pointed almost directly ahead as I walked up the lane towards Appleton Sports Field. But as I got closer, I realised to my disappointment that the hashpoint was going to be about 25 metres into the adjacant field, guarded by a trio of bullocks. At 15:00 I declared the expedition a failure. The doggo and I completed an exploration of the lane and had a look around the sports field, spotted a pair of muntjack deer ambling around, and then headed back home.\nI’ll be back in Appleton later today to buy a Christmas tree, so I’ll wave at the cattle as I go past, again.\nTracklog\nMy GPSr kept a tracklog; note that this was an “on the way” stopoff so the start and end point isn’t the same!\n Map showing a line heading into Appleton from the South-West, diverting up the lane towards the Sports Field, and then turning back and leaving by the same route.

But back in the day, there used to be a human with a <a title=\"Wikipedia article: Tannoy\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tannoy\">Tannoy</a> microphone sitting in the back office, telling you about the platform alternations and destinations.</p>\n<p>I had a friend who did it as a summer job, once. For years afterwards, he had a party trick that I always quite enjoyed: you’d say the name of a terminus station on a direct line from Preston, e.g. Edinburgh Waverley, and he’d respond in his announcer-voice: <em>“calling at Lancaster, Oxenholme the Lake District, Penrith, Carlisle, Lockerbie, Haymarket, and Edinburgh Waverley”</em>, listing all of the stops on that route. It was a quirky, beautiful, and unusual talent. Amazingly, when he came to re-apply for his job the next summer he didn’t get it, which I always thought was a shame because he clearly deserved it: he could do the job blindfold!</p>\n<p>There was a strange transitional period during which we had machines to do these announcements, but they weren’t that bright. Years later I found myself on Haymarket station waiting for the next train after mine had been cancelled, when a robot voice came on to announce a platform alteration: the train to Glasgow would now be departing from platform 2, rather than platform 1. A crowd of people stood up and shuffled their way over the footbridge to the opposite side of the tracks. A minute or so later, a human announcer apologised for the inconvenience but explained that the train would be leaving from platform 1, and to disregard the previous announcement. Between then and the train’s arrival the computer tried twice more to send everybody to the wrong platform, leading to a back-and-forth argument between the machine and the human somewhat reminiscient of the <a title=\"Airplane!'s white zone/red zone scene (YouTube)\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvYOTz5n6GI\">white zone/red zone scene from <em>Airplane!</em></a> It was funny perhaps only because I wasn’t among the people whose train was in superposition.</p>\n<p>Clearly even by then we’d reached the point where the machine was well-established and it was easier to openly argue with it than to dig out the manual and work out how to turn it off. Nowadays it’s probably even moreso, but hopefully they’re less error-prone.</p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"lazy lazy-hidden aligncenter size-full wp-image-20870\" src=\"https://danq.me/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/xMercado_abasto_rosario_1931-30x22.jpg.pagespeed.ic.u8L3oGF76Z.jpg\" data-lazy-type=\"image\" data-lazy-src=\"https://danq.me/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Mercado_abasto_rosario_1931.jpg\" alt='The \"Mercado de Abasto\" (central wholesale fruit and vegetable market) of Rosario, Argentina, 1931.

                "value": "Nowadays if you’re on a railway station and hear an announcement, it’s usually a computer stitching together samples1. But back in the day, there used to be a human with a Tannoy microphone sitting in the back office, telling you about the platform alternations and destinations.\nI had a friend who did it as a summer job, once. For years afterwards, he had a party trick that I always quite enjoyed: you’d say the name of a terminus station on a direct line from Preston, e.g. Edinburgh Waverley, and he’d respond in his announcer-voice: “calling at Lancaster, Oxenholme the Lake District, Penrith, Carlisle, Lockerbie, Haymarket, and Edinburgh Waverley”, listing all of the stops on that route. It was a quirky, beautiful, and unusual talent. Amazingly, when he came to re-apply for his job the next summer he didn’t get it, which I always thought was a shame because he clearly deserved it: he could do the job blindfold!\nThere was a strange transitional period during which we had machines to do these announcements, but they weren’t that bright. Years later I found myself on Haymarket station waiting for the next train after mine had been cancelled, when a robot voice came on to announce a platform alteration: the train to Glasgow would now be departing from platform 2, rather than platform 1. A crowd of people stood up and shuffled their way over the footbridge to the opposite side of the tracks. A minute or so later, a human announcer apologised for the inconvenience but explained that the train would be leaving from platform 1, and to disregard the previous announcement. Between then and the train’s arrival the computer tried twice more to send everybody to the wrong platform, leading to a back-and-forth argument between the machine and the human somewhat reminiscient of the white zone/red zone scene from Airplane! It was funny perhaps only because I wasn’t among the people whose train was in superposition.\nClearly even by then we’d reached the point where the machine was well-established and it was easier to openly argue with it than to dig out the manual and work out how to turn it off. Nowadays it’s probably even moreso, but hopefully they’re less error-prone.\n The \"Mercado de Abasto\" (central wholesale fruit and vegetable market) of Rosario, Argentina, 1931. Horses with carts work alongide automobiles and an omnibus.  The \"Mercado de Abasto\" (central wholesale fruit and vegetable market) of Rosario, Argentina, 1931. Horses with carts work alongide automobiles and an omnibus. \nWhen people talk about how technological unemployment, they focus on the big changes, like how a tipping point with self-driving vehicles might one day revolutionise the haulage industry… along with the social upheaval that comes along with forcing a career change on millions of drivers.\nBut in the real world, automation and technological change comes in salami slices. Horses and carts were seen alongside the automobile for decades. And you still find stations with human announcers. Even the most radically-disruptive developments don’t revolutionise the world overnight. Change is inevitable, but with preparation, we can be ready for it.\nFootnotes1 Like ScotRail’s set, voiced by Alison McKay, which computers can even remix for you over a low-fi hiphop beat if you like."
