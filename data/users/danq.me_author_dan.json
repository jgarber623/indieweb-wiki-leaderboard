As well as getting rest, it‚Äôs meant that I‚Äôve managed to avoid writing production code with my addled brain! Instead, I‚Äôve spent a lot of time chilling in bed and watching all of the films that I‚Äôd been meaning to! This week, I‚Äôve watched:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091738/\"><em>Peggy Sue Got Married</em></a> (y‚Äôknow, that <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088763/\"><em>other</em></a> mid-1980s movie about time travel and being a teenager in the 1950s). It was okay; some bits of the direction were spectacular for its age, like the ‚Äúthrough the mirror‚Äù filming.</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15325794/\"><em>Fall</em></a>. I enjoyed this more than I expected to. It‚Äôs not great, but while I spent most of the time complaining about the lack of believability in the setting and the characters‚Äô reactions, the acting was good and the tension ‚Äúworked‚Äù: it was ocassionally pretty vertigo-inducing, and that‚Äôs not just because I‚Äôve been having some Covid-related dizziness!</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8178634/\"><em>RRR</em></a>. Oh my god this Tollywood action spectacle was an adventure. At one point it‚Äôs a bromantic buddy comedy, then later there‚Äôs a dance-off, then for a while there‚Äôs a wonderful ‚Äúeven language can‚Äôt divide us‚Äù romance, but then later a man picks up a motorcycle with one hand and uses it to beat up an entire army, and somehow it all feels like it belongs together.

Lateral flow test, with \"DAN\" written on it, showing a solid control line and a very clear solid test line: a clear positive result. Well, shit.\nFrankly, it‚Äôs surprising that it took this long. We‚Äôve always been careful, in accordance with guidance at any given time, nd we all got our jabs and boosters as soon as we were able‚Ä¶ but conversely: we‚Äôve got school-age children who naturally seem to be the biggest disease vectors imaginable. Our youngest, in fact, already had Covid, but the rest of us managed to dodge it perhaps thanks to all these precautions.\n Vials of Covid vaccine scattered across a red background.

As well as getting rest, it‚Äôs meant that I‚Äôve managed to avoid writing production code with my addled brain! Instead, I‚Äôve spent a lot of time chilling in bed and watching all of the films that I‚Äôd been meaning to! This week, I‚Äôve watched:\n\nPeggy Sue Got Married (y‚Äôknow, that other mid-1980s movie about time travel and being a teenager in the 1950s).

It‚Äôs not great, but while I spent most of the time complaining about the lack of believability in the setting and the characters‚Äô reactions, the acting was good and the tension ‚Äúworked‚Äù: it was ocassionally pretty vertigo-inducing, and that‚Äôs not just because I‚Äôve been having some Covid-related dizziness!\nRRR.
