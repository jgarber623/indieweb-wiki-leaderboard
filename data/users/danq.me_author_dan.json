Mains hum isn’t always present on recordings, and even when it is, our target recording’s ENF can still match with the wrong section of the reference database by statistical misfortune.\nStill, even though all ENF matching gives us is a guess, it’s usually a good one. The longer the recording, the more reliable the estimate; in the academic papers that I’ve read 10 minutes is typically given as a lower bound for getting a decent match.\nTo make our guess, we’ll need to:\n\nExtract the target recording’s ENF values over time\nFind a database of reference ENF values, taken directly from the electrical grid serving the area where the recording was made\nFind the section of the reference ENF series that best matches the target. This section is our best guess for when the target recording was taken\n\nWe’ll start at the top.\n…\nRobert Heaton"
