I hoped I might be able to slip away from work for a lunchtime cycle to claim it.</p>\n<p>But the gods of technology didn’t approve of my plan and turned my workday into a catastrophe of the kind that only a computer can, and the chance of taking a long lunch evaporated quickly. But fortune dealt me a second hand when the weather held off into the evening, and I instead opted for a post-dinner huckle in the dark out to this hashpoint.</p>\n<p>I set out around 18:30, South through Stanton Harcourt then North up the adorably-named Ducklington Road. It took some time to sight the somewhat-concealed bridleway around the hill of Cokethorpe School. And then, another challenge – navigating by OpenStreetMap I missed my turning and went straight through a farmyard, and had to carry my bike over a fence at the other end. Turns out the map is wrong and I later found a sign indicating the true course of the bridleway; <a title=\"My OpenStreetMap changeset, correcting the misplaced bridleway\" href=\"https://www.openstreetmap.org/changeset/https://www.openstreetmap.org/changeset/129776592\">I’ll get that corrected</a>.</p>\n<p>I abandoned my bike for the final 50 metres, trekking through the thick grass of an unmown meadow to the hashpoint and arriving around 19:00. No panoramic photo today it’s too dark – but you get a silly grin.</p>\n<p>Pleased with this fast expedition, I diverted on my route home to the <a href=\"https://www.theharcourtarms.com/\">Harcourt Arms</a> pub for a pint of their surprisingly-delicious seasonal guest ale, <a href=\"https://brewyork.co.uk/product/fairytale-of-brew-york-2022/\">Fairytale of Brew York</a>, which genuinely tastes like stollen. There, I wrote up this expedition report, but I’ll have to get home before I can extract my <abbr class=\"abbr\" title=\"GPS receiver\">GPSr</abbr>‘s tracklog.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Tracklog\"

I hoped I might be able to slip away from work for a lunchtime cycle to claim it.\nBut the gods of technology didn’t approve of my plan and turned my workday into a catastrophe of the kind that only a computer can, and the chance of taking a long lunch evaporated quickly. But fortune dealt me a second hand when the weather held off into the evening, and I instead opted for a post-dinner huckle in the dark out to this hashpoint.\nI set out around 18:30, South through Stanton Harcourt then North up the adorably-named Ducklington Road. It took some time to sight the somewhat-concealed bridleway around the hill of Cokethorpe School. And then, another challenge – navigating by OpenStreetMap I missed my turning and went straight through a farmyard, and had to carry my bike over a fence at the other end. Turns out the map is wrong and I later found a sign indicating the true course of the bridleway; I’ll get that corrected.\nI abandoned my bike for the final 50 metres, trekking through the thick grass of an unmown meadow to the hashpoint and arriving around 19:00. No panoramic photo today it’s too dark – but you get a silly grin.\nPleased with this fast expedition, I diverted on my route home to the Harcourt Arms pub for a pint of their surprisingly-delicious seasonal guest ale, Fairytale of Brew York, which genuinely tastes like stollen. There, I wrote up this expedition report, but I’ll have to get home before I can extract my GPSr‘s tracklog.\nTracklog\n Map showing a journey from Sutton, near Stanton Harcourt, along the B4449 then up the A415 past Cokethorpe School, then along a bridleway and into a field (where a chequered flag icon appears), then back to the centre of Stanton Harcourt (where a beer icon appears) before returning to the start point in Sutton.

If somebody comments <em>directly</em> on my blog using the form at the bottom of a post, that’s a pretty strong indicator of them giving their consent for their comment to be published at the bottom of that post (at my discretion). If somebody publicly replies somewhere my post is syndicated, that’s less-obvious, but still pretty clear. If somebody merely <em>mentions</em> my post publicly, writing their own post and linking to mine… that’s a real fuzzy area.</p>\n<p>I take a minimal approach; only capturing their full content if it’s short and otherwise trying to extract a snippet that contains the bit that mentioned my content, and I think that works great. But Terence points out an important follow-up: <em>what if the commenter deletes that content?</em></p>\n<p>My approach so far has always been a reactive one – the second in Terence’s list – and I think it’s a morally-acceptable stance for a personal blogger. But I’m not sure it scales. I find myself asking: what if a news outlet did this, taking my self-published feedback to their story and publishing it on their site, even if I later amended, retracted, or deleted it on my own?

(A massive faff to set up.)\n\n…\n\nTerence Eden\n\n\nTerence describes a problem that I’ve wrestled with myself. If somebody comments directly on my blog using the form at the bottom of a post, that’s a pretty strong indicator of them giving their consent for their comment to be published at the bottom of that post (at my discretion). If somebody publicly replies somewhere my post is syndicated, that’s less-obvious, but still pretty clear. If somebody merely mentions my post publicly, writing their own post and linking to mine… that’s a real fuzzy area.\nI take a minimal approach; only capturing their full content if it’s short and otherwise trying to extract a snippet that contains the bit that mentioned my content, and I think that works great. But Terence points out an important follow-up: what if the commenter deletes that content?\nMy approach so far has always been a reactive one – the second in Terence’s list – and I think it’s a morally-acceptable stance for a personal blogger. But I’m not sure it scales. I find myself asking: what if a news outlet did this, taking my self-published feedback to their story and publishing it on their site, even if I later amended, retracted, or deleted it on my own? If somebody’s making money out of my content, that feels different: I’ve always been clear that what I write on my blog is permissively-licensed, but that permissiveness is based on the prohibition of commercial use of my content.\nPerhaps down the line this can be solved technologically: something machine-readable akin to the <link rel=\"license\" ...> tag could state an author’s preference for how their content is syndicated by third parties they’ve mentioned, answering questions like:\n\nCan you quote me, or just link to me? Who do these rules apply to? (Should we be attaching metadata to individual links?)\nShould you inform me that you’ve done so, and if so: how (WebMention, etc.)?\nIf you (or your site) observe that my content has disappeared or changed for an extended time, should that be taken as revokation of consent to syndicate it?\n\nRight now, the relevant technologies are not well-established enough to even begin this kind of work, but if a modern interconected federated web of personal websites takes off, it’s the kind of question we might one day have to answer.\nFor now my gut feeling is that option #2 (reactive moderation of syndicated comments) is ethically-sufficient for personal websites.

I’m moderately familiar with Appleton – I have a regular cycle circuit that comes right through it! – but I’ve never been out to the cricket club and sports field, so I pointed the hashing hound in the right direction and let her lead the way.</p>\n<p>At first it looked like this was going to be a successful expedition: the needle on my <abbr class=\"abbr\" title=\"GPS receiver\">GPSr</abbr> pointed almost directly ahead as I walked up the lane towards <a href=\"https://www.appleton-eaton.org/amenities/sports-field/\">Appleton Sports Field</a>. But as I got closer, I realised to my disappointment that the hashpoint was going to be about 25 metres into the adjacant field, guarded by a trio of bullocks. At 15:00 I declared the expedition a failure. The doggo and I completed an exploration of the lane and had a look around the sports field, spotted a pair of muntjack deer ambling around, and then headed back home.</p>\n<p>I’ll be back in Appleton later today to buy a Christmas tree, so I’ll wave at the cattle as I go past, again.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Tracklog\" class=\"mw-headline\">Tracklog</span></h2>\n<p>My GPSr kept a tracklog; note that this was an “on the way” stopoff so the start and end point isn’t the same!</p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"lazy lazy-hidden aligncenter size-full wp-image-20876\" src=\"https://danq.me/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/x2022-12-02-51-1-hashpoint-mini-map-30x20.png.pagespeed.ic.8x6dEvbTEU.jpg\" data-lazy-type=\"image\" data-lazy-src=\"https://danq.me/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/2022-12-02-51-1-hashpoint-mini-map.png\" alt=\"Map showing a line heading into Appleton from the South-West, diverting up the lane towards the Sports Field, and then turning back and leaving by the same route.

I’m moderately familiar with Appleton – I have a regular cycle circuit that comes right through it! – but I’ve never been out to the cricket club and sports field, so I pointed the hashing hound in the right direction and let her lead the way.\nAt first it looked like this was going to be a successful expedition: the needle on my GPSr pointed almost directly ahead as I walked up the lane towards Appleton Sports Field. But as I got closer, I realised to my disappointment that the hashpoint was going to be about 25 metres into the adjacant field, guarded by a trio of bullocks. At 15:00 I declared the expedition a failure. The doggo and I completed an exploration of the lane and had a look around the sports field, spotted a pair of muntjack deer ambling around, and then headed back home.\nI’ll be back in Appleton later today to buy a Christmas tree, so I’ll wave at the cattle as I go past, again.\nTracklog\nMy GPSr kept a tracklog; note that this was an “on the way” stopoff so the start and end point isn’t the same!\n Map showing a line heading into Appleton from the South-West, diverting up the lane towards the Sports Field, and then turning back and leaving by the same route. A cross marks the hashpoint, in a field just off to the side of the route.
