But as I got closer, I realised to my disappointment that the hashpoint was going to be about 25 metres into the adjacant field, guarded by a trio of bullocks. At 15:00 I declared the expedition a failure. The doggo and I completed an exploration of the lane and had a look around the sports field, spotted a pair of muntjack deer ambling around, and then headed back home.</p>\n<p>I’ll be back in Appleton later today to buy a Christmas tree, so I’ll wave at the cattle as I go past, again.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Tracklog\" class=\"mw-headline\">Tracklog</span></h2>\n<p>My GPSr kept a tracklog; note that this was an “on the way” stopoff so the start and end point isn’t the same!</p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"lazy lazy-hidden aligncenter size-full wp-image-20876\" src=\"https://danq.me/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/x2022-12-02-51-1-hashpoint-mini-map-30x20.png.pagespeed.ic.8x6dEvbTEU.jpg\" data-lazy-type=\"image\" data-lazy-src=\"https://danq.me/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/2022-12-02-51-1-hashpoint-mini-map.png\" alt=\"Map showing a line heading into Appleton from the South-West, diverting up the lane towards the Sports Field, and then turning back and leaving by the same route.

I’m moderately familiar with Appleton – I have a regular cycle circuit that comes right through it! – but I’ve never been out to the cricket club and sports field, so I pointed the hashing hound in the right direction and let her lead the way.\nAt first it looked like this was going to be a successful expedition: the needle on my GPSr pointed almost directly ahead as I walked up the lane towards Appleton Sports Field. But as I got closer, I realised to my disappointment that the hashpoint was going to be about 25 metres into the adjacant field, guarded by a trio of bullocks. At 15:00 I declared the expedition a failure. The doggo and I completed an exploration of the lane and had a look around the sports field, spotted a pair of muntjack deer ambling around, and then headed back home.\nI’ll be back in Appleton later today to buy a Christmas tree, so I’ll wave at the cattle as I go past, again.\nTracklog\nMy GPSr kept a tracklog; note that this was an “on the way” stopoff so the start and end point isn’t the same!\n Map showing a line heading into Appleton from the South-West, diverting up the lane towards the Sports Field, and then turning back and leaving by the same route.
