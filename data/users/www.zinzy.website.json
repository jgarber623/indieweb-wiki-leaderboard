The pandemic, a new job, and major cultural and political developments gave 2020 the rhythm of living in the eye — and sometimes in the fabric — of a hurricane.

These are some highlights:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n<strong><a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11559472/\">Ali &amp; Ava</a>:</strong> I saw this three times in a fortnight, quickly falling in love with the sincerity and softness of the film (and, granted, also a bit with Claire Rushbrook). It propelled its title track “Radio” by Sylvan Esso to the top of my playlist.</li>\n  <li>\n<strong><a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11389748/\">Mass</a>:</strong> I love me a good kammerspiel, and <em>Mass</em> is a perfect example of it. The excellent cast, tension building, handling of covert Christian themes, and the pain around school shootings took my breath away.</li>\n  <li>\n<strong><a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13352968/\">Good Luck To You, Leo Grande</a>:</strong> Anja took me to see this the day after I returned from Portugal. Emma Thompson, who has been my favorite actress and not-so-secret crush since <em>Love, Actually</em> is just pure on-screen bliss. I thought her and Daryl McCormack’s dynamic was electrifying.</li>\n  <li>\n<strong><a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11127680/\">Boiling Point</a>:</strong> this story is a fever dream, each scene making everything quietly worse than it already was. The one-take technique worked very well on me here, reminding me slightly of <em>Son of Saul</em> (to which Anja lets me compare nothing, but I’m not talking substance here), if it weren’t for the wider depth of field.</li>\n  <li>\n<strong><a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7322224/\">Triangle of Sadness</a>:</strong> this film worked incredibly well for me because I didn’t know what was going to happen. I read somewhere that the director thought that having his head in the editing process so deeply made him lose sight of just how gruesome the vomiting scene was, but I thought it was just perfect.</li>\n  <li>\n<strong><a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10954984/\">Nope</a>:</strong> this was my favorite film of the year. I need Jordan Peele to do well in life and art, and I’m glad he succeeded. The tangle of interpretations that <em>Nope</em> carries, combined with the sheer beauty and abundant safety of Black cinema made I had to see it twice in one week.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4 id=\"in-my-ear\">In my ear</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n<strong><a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2ubfQRrDsy6MEOKfptWEFt?si=70e6b75a48fa41cd\">UK garage</a></strong>: I’m at that age where, suddenly, I realize that this 90s genre was the soundtrack of an entire decade of my life.
