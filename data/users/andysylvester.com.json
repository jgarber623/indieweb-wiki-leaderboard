I apologize for the error.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have been following the development of <a href=\"http://feedland.org/\">FeedLand</a>, a new feed reader application from <a href=\"http://scripting.com/?tab=blog\">Dave Winer</a>. I have used many of the tools that Dave has developed over the years. One cost of using his tools is figuring out how to navigate a web of sometimes unclear expectations on support forums/repos. For the <a href=\"http://drummer.scripting.com/\">Drummer </a>application, it was made clear that problems related to Drummer were acceptable, but that was about all that was allowed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recently, Dave Winer added two new features to FeedLand – a way for a user to make short posts and create a RSS feed, and a collected view/river of user posts. I took a look at the feature yesterday, and decided to make a short <a href=\"http://feedland.org/?item=845084\">post </a>comparing this experience in FeedLand to an app I use for reading posts by Drummer users who blog using the Old School blogging tool. Here is the text of the post:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>In response to Ken Smith’s <a href=\"http://feedland.org/?item=841964\">comment</a> on the Read user feeds feature in FeedLand, this is the sense of community that the <a href=\"https://oldschooldrummers.andysylvester.com/\">Old School Drummers</a> river has as well. However, with the ability to post new items as you read them, thee feedback loop tightens…which is a good thing…which is like Twitter/Mastodon…hmmmm…</p>\n<cite>Post on FeedLand feed</cite>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>A little later, I decided to check to see if anyone had responded.
