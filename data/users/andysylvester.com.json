The site JustSecurity.org has a January 6 <a href=\"https://www.justsecurity.org/77022/january-6-clearinghouse/\">clearinghouse </a>of information on this event, well worth checking out, as well as a <a href=\"https://www.justsecurity.org/82975/the-january-6th-hearings-a-comprehensive-guide-to-the-evidentiary-record/\">citizen’s guide </a>to the evidentiary record.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most striking part of the hearing was the documentary video of the congressional leaders at Fort McNair filmed by Alexandra Pelosi (Nancy Pelosi’s daughter).

Her <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandra_Pelosi\">Wikipedia </a>page says she works for HBO, but she has not released any documentaries since 2020.

It was a day that I remember well, having kept a <a href=\"http://scripting.com/code/instantoutlinesrepo/demo/index.html?url=http://drummer.scripting.com/PDXProtestNews/liveblog.opml\">liveblog </a>of the day’s events (also see posts <a href=\"https://andysylvester.com/2021/01/06/liveblog-of-electoral-count-joint-session-of-congress/\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://andysylvester.com/2022/01/06/2410/\">here</a>). I think that the committee has done an excellent job of telling the story of what led up to this event and how Donald Trump was the central figure in trying to overturn the 2020 election. My fervent hope is that the Department of Justice is going to pursue Trump and hold him accountable for his crimes (i.e., indict, arrest, and convict him!). The site JustSecurity.org has a January 6 <a href=\"https://www.justsecurity.org/77022/january-6-clearinghouse/\">clearinghouse </a>of information on this event, well worth checking out, as well as a <a href=\"https://www.justsecurity.org/82975/the-january-6th-hearings-a-comprehensive-guide-to-the-evidentiary-record/\">citizen’s guide </a>to the evidentiary record.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most striking part of the hearing was the documentary video of the congressional leaders at Fort McNair filmed by Alexandra Pelosi (Nancy Pelosi’s daughter). CNN also carried more of this <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/13/politics/pelosi-jan-6-capitol-riot-video/index.html\">footage </a>the evening of the hearing (also <a href=\"https://twitter.com/therecount/status/1580638348573540355\">here</a>). It was riveting. One question came up in my wife and I discussing the hearing – how was it that Alexandra Pelosi came to be there that day? And for myself, how is it that this is the first time this footage is coming to public view? Was she planning to make a documentary with this? Her <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandra_Pelosi\">Wikipedia </a>page says she works for HBO, but she has not released any documentaries since 2020. I hope that some journalist will dig into this a little more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a></a></p>",
