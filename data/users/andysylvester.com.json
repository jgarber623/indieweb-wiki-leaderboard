This was (and still is) a gathering of like-minded people to discuss personal websites and making updates to them. The lead person was <a href=\"https://aaronparecki.com/\">Aaron Parecki</a>, one of the IndieWebCamp co-founders. We all introduced ourselves, and shared various opinions on web site development and talked about our individual sites. One of the things mentioned was the use of microformats as a technique/technology for building websites. I had not heard of this before, and looked into it more after the meeting. I then <a href=\"https://andysylvester.com/2014/02/11/my-indieweb-areas-of-interest/\">wrote a post</a> on what I was interested in exploring, and one of the items was “following other sites”. What I found in looking at other Indieweb-type sites was that they did not have any RSS feed for posts. Specifically, the two co-founders, Aaron Parecki and <a href=\"https://tantek.com/\">Tantek Celik</a>, did not have feeds available for their sites. In the next meeting I attended, I brought this up. The response was that they were using <a href=\"http://microformats.org/\">microformats </a>to encode data within their websites, and that there were microformat parsers which could read that formatted data and present it in a feed reader application. Aaron Parecki even did a hack on the Selfoss feed reader application to allow it to parse microformats-based sites and present site updates like a RSS feed reader would. I even <a href=\"https://andysylvester.com/2014/03/01/howto-setting-up-the-selfoss-feed-reader-with-microformats-support/\">wrote up some instructions</a> on how to set this up (after the fact). In the meeting, however, I asked how the attendees expected people to keep up with site updates without some type of feed to monitor. Aaron’s response was that more people needed to adopt microformats. I said that this was a “<a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/boil-the-ocean.asp#:~:text=What%20Is%20%22Boil%20the%20Ocean,job%20or%20project%20unnecessarily%20difficult.\">boil the ocean</a>” strategy and that people who use feeds to monitor sites expect to use RSS and Atom, not microformats.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometime after that, I noticed that both Aaron Parecki and Tantek Celik started providing a feed for their sites, although it was really a feed generated by some other application that was parsing their microformats stuff. For the next several years, though, the general trend in the group of websites that considered themselves to be part of the IndieWeb community focused on microformats and technologies that built on microformats as a building block. Over time, this overt position against RSS/Atom feeds has subsided, and (per the <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/\">IndieWeb </a>website), I would say the current focus is on the principles of (1) principles over project-centric focus, (2) publish on your site, and (3) design and UX come first, then protocols and formats are developed second. In that list, RSS and Atom become part of a “<a href=\"https://indieweb.org/different\">plurality of projects</a>“, acknowledging that there can be “more than one way to do it”, as Perl devotees like to say.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The more active IndieWeb members (Aaron Parecki and Tantek Celik leading the way) have created a number of standards based on technologies grown from implementations on Indieweb websites (<a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/webmention/\">Webmention</a>, <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/Microsub-spec\">Microsub</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/micropub/\">Micropub</a>). Time will tell if these develop into more mainstream technologies. I think Webmention (supporting site-to-site communication/commenting) is the furthest along (I have it enabled through WordPress plugin on my main site), but I am interested in exploring the others. RSS, though, has stood the test of time, and is still powering feed readers and podcast clients throughout the world. Dave Winer should rightly feel proud of his contributions in this area. RSS and podcasting are a crucial part of what I call (and others have called) the “independent web” (websites and web presences that are not part of a silo like Twitter, Facebook, etc, where people own their data and control it (also an IndieWeb <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/principles\">principle</a>)). The two areas (IndieWeb and independent web) share some features, but in my opinion, should not be considered “the same” – there are differences. My hope is that they can coexist and at times even work together, but always with respect (as the IndieWeb code of conduct <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/code-of-conduct\">states</a>: “Be respectful of other people, respectfully ask people to stop if you are bothered….”).</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"syndication-links\"></div>",
