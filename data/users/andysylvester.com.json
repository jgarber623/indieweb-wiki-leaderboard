I hope this will provide some insights into software development and technical communication, and will be of use to others using the rssCloud protocol. I hope it will also demonstrate that it can be difficult to identify/isolate problems between multiple apps/web services/web sites, and that all involved in the discussion should adopt a mindset of “follow the data” and be open to input from others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http://home.rsscloud.co/\">rssCloud </a>is a notification protocol that uses a “cloud” element in a RSS feed. This element contains information on a cloud server that is supporting this feed. A feed reader app can read the RSS feed and register with the server listed in the cloud element to be notified when the feed updates. The producer of the RSS feed can then “ping” the server to let it know that updates are available, and the server can inform apps that registered that feed that updates are available. The cloud element was included in version 2.0 of the <a href=\"https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html\">RSS specification</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The protocol has been supported in the blogging tools that Dave Winer developed since 2001 (<a href=\"http://radio.userland.com/\">Radio Userland</a> (feed reader/blogging) and <a href=\"http://manila.userland.com/\">Manila </a>(blogging)). Since that time, several other tools added support for adding the cloud element to RSS feeds (<a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/django-rsscloud/\">Django</a>, <a href=\"https://metacpan.org/dist/XML-RSS/changes\">Perl XML-RSS</a>, and <a href=\"https://ocaml.org/p/syndic/1.5.3/doc/Syndic_rss2/index.html\">syndic-rss2</a>). In 2009, Matt Mullenweg <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/blog/2009/09/07/rss-in-the-clouds/\">announced </a>that WordPress.com blogs would support rssCloud, and that a <a href=\"https://blog.josephscott.org/2009/09/07/rsscloud-for-wordpress/\">plugin </a>would be available for WordPress.org blogs. A unique feature of the WordPress implementation is that the WordPress blog itself is the cloud server. A result of this was that a user did not have to find a rssCloud server for their feed to reference – their own site could handle feed registrations and notifications to feed reader apps. This created a supply of literally millions of weblogs that could support quick notifications to their readers if their reading app supported the use of rssCloud. However, for the most part, only feed readers and apps developed by Dave Winer supported the protocol (<a href=\"https://wptavern.com/my-head-is-in-the-rss-cloud\">River2 </a>(OPML Editor app), <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/river4\">River4</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/river5\">River5</a> (Node.js apps), <a href=\"http://radio3.smallpict.com/2015/06/05/rsscloudSupportInRadio3.html\">Radio3</a> (Node.js) and now <a href=\"http://feedland.org/\">FeedLand</a> (Node.js)).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some users noted issues with rssCloud support back in 2009 as WordPress.com rolled out its rssCloud support. <a href=\"http://www.xn--8ws00zhy3a.com/blog/2009/10/rss-cloud-fail\">One of the posts</a> from this period highlighted the problems with registering an application with the rssCloud server associated with the WordPress.com blog. I began looking at rssCloud in 2015 and 2016 with limited success, and tried to develop a separate plugin, but had issues. I have been aware for several years that there were problems with River5 working with WordPress.com blogs and WordPress.org blogs in terms of rssCloud support, but I did not have the Node.js knowledge to adequately figure out the issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After the rollout of FeedLand (Dave Winer’s latest feed application), a user, Colin Walker, started asking questions about rssCloud so that he could support it in his custom blog/reader application, and Dave Winer said he <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/reallysimple/issues/11#issue-1453438627\">wanted people to ask questions</a> about rssCloud, so I thought this was the right time to <a href=\"https://andysylvester.com/2022/12/04/rss-cloud-support-in-wordpress-com-not-working/\">bring up the WordPress.com problem</a> and document it to the best of my ability. I also tried to not say that it was a FeedLand problem, but to me the end result was that FeedLand was not doing what WordPress.com wanted to support rssCloud. Since Joseph Scott indicated that the WordPress.com implementation <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/andrewshell/8b57f96bf62a1dea9fa1a8137e13951a?permalink_comment_id=4396779#gistcomment-4396779\">would not be changing</a>, it was FeedLand that had to change (and other rssCloud apps that might want to say that they work with WordPress.com blogs). I didn’t get much, if any, credit for bringing this up, but I did identify the problem and tried to <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2021/12/18.html#a034800\">provide the level of info</a> that Dave Winer seems to want/need before looking into a problem. During the investigation, Andrew Shell determined that the WordPress cloud server <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/andrewshell/8b57f96bf62a1dea9fa1a8137e13951a?permalink_comment_id=4395192#gistcomment-4395192\">would only respond to requests from ports 80, 443, and 8080</a>. This fact alone would be a valid explanation of why River5 (which ran on a default port of 1337) would not be able to register with a WordPress site or get notifications. However, this was not documented in any of the WordPress posts listed above regarding rollout of RSS Cloud support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dave Winer then published a <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/reallysimple/tree/main/demos/clouddemo\">reference app</a> for testing rssCloud implementations (https://github.com/scripting/reallysimple/tree/main/demos/clouddemo). I tried to comment on the reallySimple repo, but I saw this:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://andysylvester.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/RssCloudBlock.png\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"666\" src=\"https://andysylvester.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/RssCloudBlock-1024x666.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2723\" srcset=\"https://andysylvester.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/RssCloudBlock-1024x666.png 1024w, https://andysylvester.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/RssCloudBlock-300x195.png 300w, https://andysylvester.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/RssCloudBlock-768x500.png 768w, https://andysylvester.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/RssCloudBlock-700x456.png 700w, https://andysylvester.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/RssCloudBlock.png 1114w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"></a><figcaption>Screen capture from <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/reallysimple/issues/12\">Github repo issue</a></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>…so I posted my report <a href=\"https://andysylvester.com/2022/12/17/test-results-for-rsscloud-app-from-dave-winer/\">on my own blog</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I checked, and saw that Github does have <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/communities/moderating-comments-and-conversations\">moderation features</a> which allow repo owners to block people.

Being his repo, he can do what he wants. However, to me that does not give the impression that Dave is open to feedback, even though he asked for feedback at the top of the issue (I guess it was just my feedback he did not want). I later checked and saw that I saw the same response on other repos within <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting\">github.com/scripting</a>, so I assume I am blocked from all of those repos.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is not the first time I have identified problems in how Dave Winer approaches <a href=\"https://andysylvester.com/2022/12/10/an-unfortunate-exercise-of-editorial-discretion-by-dave-winer/\">comments about him</a> or <a href=\"https://andysylvester.com/2022/03/18/my-impressions-of-the-current-state-of-drummer/\">his products</a>. I know he has “guidelines” to handle feedback, and that is his right. At this time in my life (I turned 60 earlier this year, I know Dave is 67-68), I tend more to “call it like I see it” in as factual a manner as I can. If that is what Dave Winer thinks of as “<a href=\"http://scripting.com/2022/12/13.html#a134833\">trolls, spammers, and abusers</a>“, I can’t do anything about that. However, I don’t think I fit into any of those categories.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With <a href=\"http://feedland.org/?item=880552\">the help</a> of <a href=\"https://blog.andrewshell.org/\">Andrew Shell</a>, Dave Winer was able to update FeedLand so that it supports display of WordPress.com and WordPress.org blog posts in near-real-time. I am seeing some RSS feed caching issues with WordPress, which I am continuing to document on a <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/andrewshell/8b57f96bf62a1dea9fa1a8137e13951a?permalink_comment_id=4410035#gistcomment-4410035\">Github gist thread</a>. Joseph Scott of Automattic has been very helpful with ideas. I was able to demonstrate that the new version of the rssCloud plugin (0.5.0) supported registration and notification with FeedLand, but subsequent tests with test scripts are showing the RSS feed caching problem I saw last week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a rssCloud project in mind that I would like to develop, but I want all WordPress users to be able to take advantage of rssCloud.

                "html": "<p>This is an attempt to capture some work/events I have been involved with over the last few weeks regarding the rssCloud protocol. I hope this will provide some insights into software development and technical communication, and will be of use to others using the rssCloud protocol. I hope it will also demonstrate that it can be difficult to identify/isolate problems between multiple apps/web services/web sites, and that all involved in the discussion should adopt a mindset of “follow the data” and be open to input from others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http://home.rsscloud.co/\">rssCloud </a>is a notification protocol that uses a “cloud” element in a RSS feed. This element contains information on a cloud server that is supporting this feed. A feed reader app can read the RSS feed and register with the server listed in the cloud element to be notified when the feed updates. The producer of the RSS feed can then “ping” the server to let it know that updates are available, and the server can inform apps that registered that feed that updates are available. The cloud element was included in version 2.0 of the <a href=\"https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html\">RSS specification</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The protocol has been supported in the blogging tools that Dave Winer developed since 2001 (<a href=\"http://radio.userland.com/\">Radio Userland</a> (feed reader/blogging) and <a href=\"http://manila.userland.com/\">Manila </a>(blogging)). Since that time, several other tools added support for adding the cloud element to RSS feeds (<a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/django-rsscloud/\">Django</a>, <a href=\"https://metacpan.org/dist/XML-RSS/changes\">Perl XML-RSS</a>, and <a href=\"https://ocaml.org/p/syndic/1.5.3/doc/Syndic_rss2/index.html\">syndic-rss2</a>). In 2009, Matt Mullenweg <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/blog/2009/09/07/rss-in-the-clouds/\">announced </a>that WordPress.com blogs would support rssCloud, and that a <a href=\"https://blog.josephscott.org/2009/09/07/rsscloud-for-wordpress/\">plugin </a>would be available for WordPress.org blogs. A unique feature of the WordPress implementation is that the WordPress blog itself is the cloud server. A result of this was that a user did not have to find a rssCloud server for their feed to reference – their own site could handle feed registrations and notifications to feed reader apps. This created a supply of literally millions of weblogs that could support quick notifications to their readers if their reading app supported the use of rssCloud. However, for the most part, only feed readers and apps developed by Dave Winer supported the protocol (<a href=\"https://wptavern.com/my-head-is-in-the-rss-cloud\">River2 </a>(OPML Editor app), <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/river4\">River4</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/river5\">River5</a> (Node.js apps), <a href=\"http://radio3.smallpict.com/2015/06/05/rsscloudSupportInRadio3.html\">Radio3</a> (Node.js) and now <a href=\"http://feedland.org/\">FeedLand</a> (Node.js)).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some users noted issues with rssCloud support back in 2009 as WordPress.com rolled out its rssCloud support. <a href=\"http://www.xn--8ws00zhy3a.com/blog/2009/10/rss-cloud-fail\">One of the posts</a> from this period highlighted the problems with registering an application with the rssCloud server associated with the WordPress.com blog. I began looking at rssCloud in 2015 and 2016 with limited success, and tried to develop a separate plugin, but had issues. I have been aware for several years that there were problems with River5 working with WordPress.com blogs and WordPress.org blogs in terms of rssCloud support, but I did not have the Node.js knowledge to adequately figure out the issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After the rollout of FeedLand (Dave Winer’s latest feed application), a user, Colin Walker, started asking questions about rssCloud so that he could support it in his custom blog/reader application, and Dave Winer said he <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/reallysimple/issues/11#issue-1453438627\">wanted people to ask questions</a> about rssCloud, so I thought this was the right time to <a href=\"https://andysylvester.com/2022/12/04/rss-cloud-support-in-wordpress-com-not-working/\">bring up the WordPress.com problem</a> and document it to the best of my ability. I also tried to not say that it was a FeedLand problem, but to me the end result was that FeedLand was not doing what WordPress.com wanted to support rssCloud. Since Joseph Scott indicated that the WordPress.com implementation <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/andrewshell/8b57f96bf62a1dea9fa1a8137e13951a?permalink_comment_id=4396779#gistcomment-4396779\">would not be changing</a>, it was FeedLand that had to change (and other rssCloud apps that might want to say that they work with WordPress.com blogs). I didn’t get much, if any, credit for bringing this up, but I did identify the problem and tried to <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2021/12/18.html#a034800\">provide the level of info</a> that Dave Winer seems to want/need before looking into a problem. During the investigation, Andrew Shell determined that the WordPress cloud server <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/andrewshell/8b57f96bf62a1dea9fa1a8137e13951a?permalink_comment_id=4395192#gistcomment-4395192\">would only respond to requests from ports 80, 443, and 8080</a>. This fact alone would be a valid explanation of why River5 (which ran on a default port of 1337) would not be able to register with a WordPress site or get notifications. However, this was not documented in any of the WordPress posts listed above regarding rollout of RSS Cloud support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dave Winer then published a <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/reallysimple/tree/main/demos/clouddemo\">reference app</a> for testing rssCloud implementations (https://github.com/scripting/reallysimple/tree/main/demos/clouddemo). I tried to comment on the reallySimple repo, but I saw this:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://andysylvester.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/RssCloudBlock.png\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"666\" src=\"https://andysylvester.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/RssCloudBlock-1024x666.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2723\" srcset=\"https://andysylvester.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/RssCloudBlock-1024x666.png 1024w, https://andysylvester.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/RssCloudBlock-300x195.png 300w, https://andysylvester.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/RssCloudBlock-768x500.png 768w, https://andysylvester.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/RssCloudBlock-700x456.png 700w, https://andysylvester.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/RssCloudBlock.png 1114w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"></a><figcaption>Screen capture from <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/reallysimple/issues/12\">Github repo issue</a></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>…so I posted my report <a href=\"https://andysylvester.com/2022/12/17/test-results-for-rsscloud-app-from-dave-winer/\">on my own blog</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I checked, and saw that Github does have <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/communities/moderating-comments-and-conversations\">moderation features</a> which allow repo owners to block people.
