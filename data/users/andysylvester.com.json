Subscribed to the site in FeedLand (http://feedland.org/) (best RSS reader for RSS Cloud support)\n\n\n\n3. Reviewed Joseph Scott original blog post on rssCloud support in WP and using WP plugin https://blog.josephscott.org/2009/09/07/rsscloud-for-wordpress/\n\n\n\n4. Modified my rssCloud test script (https://gist.github.com/andysylvester/d41a6ee6b3a7d0860c039ccbe3c6147f) for Node.js RSS Cloud server (http://rpc.rsscloud.io:5337/) to access the RSS Cloud setup for my site (https://rsscloud4.wordpress.com)\n\n\n\na. var urlRssCloudServer = “https://rsscloud4.wordpress.com/?rsscloud=notify“;\n\n\n\nb. var urlHackerNews = “https://rsscloud4.wordpress.com/feed/“\n\n\n\n5. Modified function pleaseNotify to display the text of the response from the rssCloud server (my WordPress.com site).\n\n\n\nWhat I saw:\n\n\n\n1. Ran the test script (node testscript.js), got the following response:\n\n\n\nroot@AndyDO-03:~/rssCloudSimple# node rssCloudTestOriginal05.js\n\n\n\ntestRssCloud v0.40 running on port 2222.\n\n\n\nresponse: == <?xml version=’1.0′?>\n\n\n\n<notifyResult success=’false’ msg=’Error testing notification URL : A valid URL was not provided.’ />\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\npleaseNotify: success == undefined, msg == “undefined”\n\n\n\n2. Made a post (https://rsscloud4.wordpress.com/2022/12/04/test-post-007/) at 2:18 pm, no response to my test script.\n\n\n\n3. Checked in FeedLand for new item, did not see it until 2:28pm (10 minutes later). In testing of other tools creating RSS feeds with rssCloud support, the item would appear in FeedLand within a few seconds. I have noticed that feed readers seem to take up to 30 minutes to detect that there has been a change in a RSS feed from WordPress.com or WordPress.org sites.\n\n\n\nWhat I expected:\n\n\n\n1. My script would get a notification that the registration was successful.\n\n\n\n2. My script would get a notification from the WordPress.com site when a new post was made.\n\n\n\n3. A new post from my WordPress.com site would appear within a few seconds in FeedLand, since I had seen this behavior for other tools creating RSS feeds with rssCloud support\n\n\n\nI did some searching on rssCloud problems with WordPress.com/WordPress.org, and found this post from 2009 (http://www.xn--8ws00zhy3a.com/blog/2009/10/rss-cloud-fail) which described issues with notification URLs:\n\n\n\n“Still, we were getting somewhere. There were only two remaining unexplained failures. These were WordPress feeds that were somehow failing to connect to my notification URL. Eventually, after digging through various releases of the WordPress source code, I discovered that these servers were actually running a buggy, older version of the WordPress plugin. Regardless of what the client specified, this version of the plugin would always attempt connections on port 80. “\n\n\n\nMy app is running on port 2222, the notification URL that the WordPress.com site should be trying to contact is http://fedwiki.andysylvester.com:2222/feedupdated. Could someone shed some light on this? Thanks."
