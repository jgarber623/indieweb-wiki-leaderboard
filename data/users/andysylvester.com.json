I thought about it and today realized what is it – a bootstrap to develop something new. Dave Winer has been referring to bootstraps throughout his blogging career (this essay is an excellent summary, and it is over 20 years old). The concept of MyStatusTool is a specific type of bootstrap:\n\n\n\nMy Status Tool is an application that provides the basic posting and reading functionality within Twitter, but using RSS and rssCloud as the enabling technologies.from https://github.com/andysylvester/myStatusToolDemo\n\n\n\nSo, really, this is a bootstrap of a new type of Twitter. Dave Winer had a post about this in 2010:\n\n\n\nAnyway, to answer the question posed by this piece — you bootstrap the federated 140-character loosely coupled network the same way you bootstrap anything. Let’s start with something very very simple, like two tin cans separated with a string. Something that is useful, perhaps minimally so, and can be federated. Then we use it. Then we think. Then we improve it. Start with working code. Start tomorrow, not next month. from http://scripting.com/stories/2010/08/10/howToBootstrapFederated140.html\n\n\n\nI will have more to say about this in the coming days – let me know if you want to be a part of this bootstrap!"
