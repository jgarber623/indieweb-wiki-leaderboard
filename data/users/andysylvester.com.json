In my post, I defined it as “websites and web presences that are not part of a silo like Twitter, Facebook, etc, where people own their data and control it”. An extension of this is using technologies like RSS for checking for site updates and for podcasting, which are not controlled by another platform (even though entities like Spotify and other streaming services would like to “capture and keep users” within their ecosystems). Wanting to double-check, I did some searching to see if there were other references to this phrase. and found a number of links I will add at the end of this post. To me, the key aspect of “independent web” is not being dependent on a silo (like Twitter or Facebook). This can be self-hosting or hosting on a service that provides good export (<a href=\"https://micro.blog/\">Micro.blog</a> as an example). I recently wrote a <a href=\"https://andysylvester.com/2022/06/23/how-easy-should-it-be-to-create-a-website/\">post </a>about how easy should it be to create a website, based on a discussion between several bloggers. The key point of that discussion, to me, was that Twitter/Facebook provides ease of use/setup/no cost, but also a lack of control. To me, if you want to have an independent site, you should be prepared to pay something for it, and the cost of hosting a weblog or website is pretty low. Finally, to me, the use of the term “<a href=\"https://indieweb.org/\">IndieWeb</a>” has grown somewhat beyond this “independent web” definition to include using technologies like <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/webmention/\">Webmention </a>as part of a website to site-to-site communication. Again, to me sites don’t have to use Webmention to be considered part of the independent web.

I would like to provide a little background from my participation in the IndieWeb community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://andysylvester.com/2014/01/31/my-notes-from-the-homebrew-website-meeting-pdx/\">January 2014</a>, I attended a Homebrew Website Club meeting. This was (and still is) a gathering of like-minded people to discuss personal websites and making updates to them. The lead person was <a href=\"https://aaronparecki.com/\">Aaron Parecki</a>, one of the IndieWebCamp co-founders. We all introduced ourselves, and shared various opinions on web site development and talked about our individual sites. One of the things mentioned was the use of microformats as a technique/technology for building websites. I had not heard of this before, and looked into it more after the meeting. I then <a href=\"https://andysylvester.com/2014/02/11/my-indieweb-areas-of-interest/\">wrote a post</a> on what I was interested in exploring, and one of the items was “following other sites”. What I found in looking at other Indieweb-type sites was that they did not have any RSS feed for posts. Specifically, the two co-founders, Aaron Parecki and <a href=\"https://tantek.com/\">Tantek Celik</a>, did not have feeds available for their sites. In the next meeting I attended, I brought this up. The response was that they were using <a href=\"http://microformats.org/\">microformats </a>to encode data within their websites, and that there were microformat parsers which could read that formatted data and present it in a feed reader application. Aaron Parecki even did a hack on the Selfoss feed reader application to allow it to parse microformats-based sites and present site updates like a RSS feed reader would. I even <a href=\"https://andysylvester.com/2014/03/01/howto-setting-up-the-selfoss-feed-reader-with-microformats-support/\">wrote up some instructions</a> on how to set this up (after the fact). In the meeting, however, I asked how the attendees expected people to keep up with site updates without some type of feed to monitor. Aaron’s response was that more people needed to adopt microformats.

The response was that they were using microformats to encode data within their websites, and that there were microformat parsers which could read that formatted data and present it in a feed reader application.
