I thought that was great how Ken added a link to a “Get involved” page on how to be a part of how his <a href=\"http://my.feedland.org/KenSmith\">NASA </a>news product is put together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My contribution to this discussion is to point back to two posts (<a href=\"http://oldschool.scripting.com/PDXProtestNews/2022/05/24/191959.html?title=lookingForToolsForACitizensToolkit\">Looking for tools for a citizen’s toolkit</a> and <a href=\"http://oldschool.scripting.com/AndySylvester99/2022/10/13/221244.html?title=usingNonviolenceTechniquesToAchieveGoals\">Using non-violence techniques to achieve goals</a>) where I collected some resources for training for activism. Ken, how can you and I get these into some of these things you are publishing? You talk about “Almost nobody’s helping us educate ourselves on activism that has a chance.” Well, let’s do something about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To start, I have just created a public OPML <a href=\"http://drummer.this.how/AndySylvester99/Activism_Links.opml?format=opml\">file </a>with the links from these posts, it can be viewed <a href=\"http://drummer.this.how/AndySylvester99/Activism_Links.opml\">here</a>. If you have other links to add (or if other readers have links), I will add them. Then, you and I should continue to refer to this list whenever the subject of “how to learn how to be an activist” or “how to get involved” or FILL IN THE BLANK HERE comes up. How does that sound? Let me know what you think – over to you!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"syndication-links\"></div>",

I read through a bunch of pages on zettelkasten stuff yesterday, and I am thinking of starting an open zettlekasten. With a nod to the Working Out Loud crowd, I am going to outline my initial plans in this post.\n\n\n\nThe item that Chris showed me was a picture and short caption describing what the picture meant. From this, I could see that an item/card in a zettelkasten could be just a reference to something with a short description. A type of information that I collect on a regular basis is links to posts/articles/things that I read in my feed reader. I have wanted to organize/classify all of these links, but have struggled to get started. I looked at Tom Critchlow’s wiki on his site, and saw a number of references to links where the link and an excerpt or summary was provided. I also saw an article on ZettelKasten.de about filtering flow from RSS feeds into a zettelkasten. From another ZettelKasten.de post, quotes and excerpts from sources are part of the chain of increasing value of knowledge within a zettlekasten system. Finally, Chris Aldrich, in an earlier post, gave his own advice for starting a commonplace book – “The general idea is to collect interesting passages, quotes, and ideas as you read”.\n\n\n\nBased on this survey, I am going to experiment with collecting and organizing links within an OPML document and in Markdown files. Both of these methods of capture should be able to produce an organized output (OPML using XSLT style sheets, Markdown files using Hugo to render them (hopefully like Tom Critchlow’s wiki, even though he used Jekyll). For my five regular readers – let me know what you think!\n\n\n\nPS – I noticed that yesterday I misspelled “zettelkasten” – sorry!"
