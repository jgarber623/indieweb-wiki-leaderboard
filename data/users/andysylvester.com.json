In my post, I defined it as “websites and web presences that are not part of a silo like Twitter, Facebook, etc, where people own their data and control it”. An extension of this is using technologies like RSS for checking for site updates and for podcasting, which are not controlled by another platform (even though entities like Spotify and other streaming services would like to “capture and keep users” within their ecosystems). Wanting to double-check, I did some searching to see if there were other references to this phrase. and found a number of links I will add at the end of this post. To me, the key aspect of “independent web” is not being dependent on a silo (like Twitter or Facebook). This can be self-hosting or hosting on a service that provides good export (<a href=\"https://micro.blog/\">Micro.blog</a> as an example). I recently wrote a <a href=\"https://andysylvester.com/2022/06/23/how-easy-should-it-be-to-create-a-website/\">post </a>about how easy should it be to create a website, based on a discussion between several bloggers. The key point of that discussion, to me, was that Twitter/Facebook provides ease of use/setup/no cost, but also a lack of control. To me, if you want to have an independent site, you should be prepared to pay something for it, and the cost of hosting a weblog or website is pretty low. Finally, to me, the use of the term “<a href=\"https://indieweb.org/\">IndieWeb</a>” has grown somewhat beyond this “independent web” definition to include using technologies like <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/webmention/\">Webmention </a>as part of a website to site-to-site communication. Again, to me sites don’t have to use Webmention to be considered part of the independent web. I hope this helps answer the question my reader had.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other links on “the independent web”:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/the-independent-web-2011-2\">Business Insider</a> – The Independent Web</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://battellemedia.com/archives/2010/10/identity_and_the_independent_web_\">John Battelle</a> – Identity and the Independent Web</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2021/04/what-is-the-independent-web-and-does-it-matter-in-2021/\">Web Designer Depot</a> – What is the Independent Web and Does It Matter in 2021?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://victoria.dev/blog/make-your-own-independent-website/\">Victoria Drake</a> – Make your own independent website</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://thehistoryoftheweb.com/november-2020-weblog-weird-web-independent-web/\">The History of the Web</a> – Toward an independent web</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://mentalpivot.com/support-the-independent-web-reach-out-to-creators-you-appreciate/\">Mental Pivot</a> – Support the independent web</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a></a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"syndication-links\"></div>",

I recently wrote a post about how easy should it be to create a website, based on a discussion between several bloggers. The key point of that discussion, to me, was that Twitter/Facebook provides ease of use/setup/no cost, but also a lack of control. To me, if you want to have an independent site, you should be prepared to pay something for it, and the cost of hosting a weblog or website is pretty low. Finally, to me, the use of the term “IndieWeb” has grown somewhat beyond this “independent web” definition to include using technologies like Webmention as part of a website to site-to-site communication.

This was (and still is) a gathering of like-minded people to discuss personal websites and making updates to them. The lead person was <a href=\"https://aaronparecki.com/\">Aaron Parecki</a>, one of the IndieWebCamp co-founders. We all introduced ourselves, and shared various opinions on web site development and talked about our individual sites. One of the things mentioned was the use of microformats as a technique/technology for building websites. I had not heard of this before, and looked into it more after the meeting. I then <a href=\"https://andysylvester.com/2014/02/11/my-indieweb-areas-of-interest/\">wrote a post</a> on what I was interested in exploring, and one of the items was “following other sites”. What I found in looking at other Indieweb-type sites was that they did not have any RSS feed for posts. Specifically, the two co-founders, Aaron Parecki and <a href=\"https://tantek.com/\">Tantek Celik</a>, did not have feeds available for their sites. In the next meeting I attended, I brought this up. The response was that they were using <a href=\"http://microformats.org/\">microformats </a>to encode data within their websites, and that there were microformat parsers which could read that formatted data and present it in a feed reader application. Aaron Parecki even did a hack on the Selfoss feed reader application to allow it to parse microformats-based sites and present site updates like a RSS feed reader would. I even <a href=\"https://andysylvester.com/2014/03/01/howto-setting-up-the-selfoss-feed-reader-with-microformats-support/\">wrote up some instructions</a> on how to set this up (after the fact). In the meeting, however, I asked how the attendees expected people to keep up with site updates without some type of feed to monitor. Aaron’s response was that more people needed to adopt microformats. I said that this was a “<a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/boil-the-ocean.asp#:~:text=What%20Is%20%22Boil%20the%20Ocean,job%20or%20project%20unnecessarily%20difficult.\">boil the ocean</a>” strategy and that people who use feeds to monitor sites expect to use RSS and Atom, not microformats.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometime after that, I noticed that both Aaron Parecki and Tantek Celik started providing a feed for their sites, although it was really a feed generated by some other application that was parsing their microformats stuff. For the next several years, though, the general trend in the group of websites that considered themselves to be part of the IndieWeb community focused on microformats and technologies that built on microformats as a building block. Over time, this overt position against RSS/Atom feeds has subsided, and (per the <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/\">IndieWeb </a>website), I would say the current focus is on the principles of (1) principles over project-centric focus, (2) publish on your site, and (3) design and UX come first, then protocols and formats are developed second. In that list, RSS and Atom become part of a “<a href=\"https://indieweb.org/different\">plurality of projects</a>“, acknowledging that there can be “more than one way to do it”, as Perl devotees like to say.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The more active IndieWeb members (Aaron Parecki and Tantek Celik leading the way) have created a number of standards based on technologies grown from implementations on Indieweb websites (<a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/webmention/\">Webmention</a>, <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/Microsub-spec\">Microsub</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/micropub/\">Micropub</a>). Time will tell if these develop into more mainstream technologies. I think Webmention (supporting site-to-site communication/commenting) is the furthest along (I have it enabled through WordPress plugin on my main site), but I am interested in exploring the others. RSS, though, has stood the test of time, and is still powering feed readers and podcast clients throughout the world. Dave Winer should rightly feel proud of his contributions in this area. RSS and podcasting are a crucial part of what I call (and others have called) the “independent web” (websites and web presences that are not part of a silo like Twitter, Facebook, etc, where people own their data and control it (also an IndieWeb <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/principles\">principle</a>)). The two areas (IndieWeb and independent web) share some features, but in my opinion, should not be considered “the same” – there are differences. My hope is that they can coexist and at times even work together, but always with respect (as the IndieWeb code of conduct <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/code-of-conduct\">states</a>: “Be respectful of other people, respectfully ask people to stop if you are bothered….”).</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"syndication-links\"></div>",
