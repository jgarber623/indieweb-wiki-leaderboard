This allows for the creation of decentralized, trust-less systems and the potential for a wide range of applications beyond just digital currency (in theory.

But maybe you wish that when you double-click a file, it opens in Quick Look instead of in Preview or Microsoft Word or whatever. It’s actually a lot easier to do this than you might think. Then again, it’s not super easy, either.\n\nSet up the App\n    You ARE installing an app when you do this. But don’t worry – you don’t need to download a single file for this. Just follow these simple directions to quickly build the app yourself! \n\n    First, hit ⌘+Space. Now type “Script Editor” into Spotlight and hit Return on your keyboard. You’ve now opened Script Editor, where you’ll be creating this script. \n\n    Type (or Copy and Paste) the following into the window: \non run\n\tset this_application_file to the path to me\n\ttell application “System Events”\n\t\tset this_version to (the short version of this_application_file) as string\n\tend tell\n\tset the dialog_title to application_name & space & “v” & this_version\n\t\n\tactivate\n\tdisplay dialog “Open a file with this app or drop it onto this Dock icon to show it in Quick Look” buttons {“Cool”} default button 1 with icon 1 with title dialog_title\nend run\n\non open these_items\n\tset these_paths to “”\n\trepeat with i from 1 to the count of these_items\n\t\tset these_paths to these_paths & space & (the quoted form of the POSIX path of (item i of these_items))\n\tend repeat\n\t\n\tdo shell script “qlmanage -p ” & these_paths & ” >& /dev/null”\nend open\n\n    Now, hit ⌘+S. In the following dialog, make sure everything looks EXACTLY like this: \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Now click Save to continue.
