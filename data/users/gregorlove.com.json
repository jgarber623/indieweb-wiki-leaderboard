From the clips, I would say at most 10% of people were masked indoors. I searched the event page for “covid” or “mask” but only found info on a sub-page. It said they were providing masks (good) and hoping that as community leaders, everyone would model the precautions they’re asking of the public by volunteering to wear masks indoors (WTF). To top it all off, their slogan was “Building an equitable future.” Infuriating. Not wearing a mask at a crowded indoor event is definitely not contributing to an equitable future."
