Micropub is a standard that lets you publish to your site using third-party clients.

Follow the prompts and note the additional fields for “scope” and “expiration,” since you are authorizing an application to interact with your site. After successfully authorizing, try to post a short note from Quill. Quill should redirect you to the new post if it was successful.</p>\n\n<p>For a list of other Micropub clients you can try, see <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/Micropub/Clients\">https://indieweb.org/Micropub/Clients</a>.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"no-margin\"><img alt=\"screenshot\" class=\"screenshot util-max-full-width\" src=\"https://gregorlove.com/site/assets/files/6031/indieauth-for-processwire-authorization.1000x0-is.png\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"small\">The authorization prompt</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<h2 class=\"delta\" id=\"admin\">Admin and Options</h2>\n\n<p>In the admin, you can see which applications you have granted access tokens to.
