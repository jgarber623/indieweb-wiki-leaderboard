This is very important because when parenting a small child everything can be going along fine and then all of a sudden things change abruptly.

With that understanding of your child as a foundation, Nelson and Duffy recommend being kind <em>and</em> firm toward your child.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My wife and I are frequently realizing that we need a new plan when my son’s behavior abruptly changes. This happened after Christmas, when my son picked up the habit of throwing all his toys on the floor and then climbing on Mom or Dad’s desk and getting into stuff<sup>2</sup>. He also started throwing marathon fits when we turned off the TV. I started getting frustrated and angry and was overly forceful in taking my son away from my desk. It wasn’t effective because my son got a defiant look in his eyes, and went right back. Things felt out of control and unworkable for me. I wished that my son would just “listen” to me more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nelson and Duffy point out that if we want our kids to be strong and assertive as adults then we can’t demand them to be quiet and compliant as kids (Ch. 2). So that argues against yelling or punishing to enforce my arbitrary rules.

Positive Discipline gives some parenting tools that can help.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First I need to understand my son’s behavior, to figure out what is age appropriate (Ch 9.). At his age play is super important so it makes sense that he would want to get into his toys right away. With more toys than normal because of Christmas, maybe he just wants to see all of them before he decides on a toy. From that perspective throwing them all on the floor makes some sense. And then getting into Mommy and Daddy’s desks makes sense too because he has a need to explore and because he wants to imitate us. Finally with the TV, my son wants to have the autonomy to decide how long to watch. So these behaviors are totally age appropriate, but very difficult for us parents. This knowledge helps diffuse my anger. My son is not a little demon, he’s just a little person trying to explore and have autonomy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next I need to take action in a kind and firm way, that is respectful of my son’s needs and desires and of mine and my wife’s. Nelson and Duffy talk about the importance of deciding what you will do instead of what you want your child to do. It makes sense to focus on what you control. So in this case, I decided to pack away some of my son’s toys to make it more manageable when he throws them on the floor. It turns out that with fewer options, he ended up playing with the toys more and got into our desks less (a nice surprise!). With the TV fits, I didn’t know what to do so I looked it up and brainstormed with my wife. We came upon the idea of using a timer to set up an agreed upon time for TV (use of timers described in Ch.5). I was shocked when my son quietly shut off the TV after the timer went off!

                "html": "<p>I’m interested in building up a personal store of knowledge – good ideas, data, memories, and notes – and saving it in a way that I can quickly and easily make use of this information. Without some external way of saving things, I tend to forget them. The dream is that these ideas and pieces of information don’t have to be re-thought up or re-found each time but can be explored to rapidly generate more ideas. Ideally this would help me solve problems and help generate new knowledge for the wider society. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In reality this has turned out to be much harder than I expected. In my experience, it is easy to save information but hard to find it and make use of it later. The vast majority of my files have never been used after I saved them. When I do happen to remember a piece of information that I want to look up, I tend to have trouble finding it. This unfortunate situation surprised me. I had bought into the idea that there is essentially no cost to saving things digitally so I should save everything, and second that digital tools should make it easy to find things. I was wrong on both counts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The difficulty of storing information became a real problem for me in grad school when I was doing research for my PhD in physics. I had to deal with countless journal articles, presentations, calculations, brainstorming sketches, experimental data, notes from talks/classes, and different versions of code (I wasn’t using version control, aaahhh!). At first, I thought my problems were just caused by the wrong organizational system. So I tried different systems, but despite having advantages and disadvantages they didn’t solve the underlying problem for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to my misadventures, I’m learning that forgetting is a feature not a bug. When I try to remember all my ideas and information, the default organizational systems struggle and while specialized tools can help they also tend to silo information. It turns out, there is a need to limit the inflow of information and the amount of work in progress. I need the information and ideas that are relevant to me, and everything else is unlikely to be needed, and should be let go. In a way my organization system for saving ideas and information is an extension of my brain. My brain is quite good at forgetting things (sometimes too good!). So while it is important to have good tools and organization, shouldn’t my system also forget things? </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\">\n\n\n\n<p>The default ways of organizing tend to be digital analogues to the way we store papers: papers on the desk, in notebooks, and in folders. These systems fail in similar ways to paper based systems. The simplest approach is to just put everything you need on the desktop, but this quickly fails if you have more than around ten files. The next simplest is to create notebooks; essentially storing the files in chronological order (for example by starting the filename with the date). This helps because you can quickly find a file if you remember when you worked on it, which tends to happen for things you recently worked on. However this approach makes it hard to see connections between ideas from different times<sup>1</sup>. You can’t re-arrange the ideas as you learn more; they are fixed in chronological order.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next strategy that I’ve tried is putting files in a folder structure according to topic. This seems like a reasonable idea, but quickly becomes quicksand for ideas. Inevitably, I need to change the folder structure as I learn to better reflect the association between my files. The changes make it hard to remember where things are and breaks any references to file paths. As I create more folders, I find it difficult to remember the context underlying the relationships between folders. This can lead to folders with mashed up collections of files and sub-folders that don’t make sense. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\">\n\n\n\n<p>Based on these struggles, I have turned to more specialized tools as a way to solve my organizational challenges. They can make a huge difference, but can create silos of information. For example, I started using <a href=\"https://www.zotero.org/\">Zotero</a> in grad school, to keep track of all my research articles. This was a huge improvement over putting papers in topic based folders and trying to cram paper keywords into the filenames. Zotero has useful tools that allowed me to generate bibliographies automatically and to save papers directly from the browser. But now I had a separate store of papers that wasn’t tightly integrated with my research data and information; it was in a separate silo. This turned into a problem when I needed to reinstall my operating system. All my other files were restored but I had trouble recovering my Zotero papers. Eventually I was able to recover them, but it highlights that separate silos increase the complexity of securing my data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately tools won’t help if the information is not useful. Marie Kondo says throw away all papers (except what you really need)<sup>2</sup>, and I think the same could be said for digital information too. She says this because according to her core principle, your things should “spark joy” and she finds papers rarely spark joy. Do my digital files and information spark joy? The majority probably don’t. I’m not totally sure because most are in these old folders that I never look at. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Information tends to bring me more joy when it is connected to something bigger, and this is where tools can help. For example, the “Untitled” file in an old folder called “New” is probably not useful. The context is lost; it is just a fragment. In contrast, a note in an Evernote notebook is part of something bigger. Evernote allows the notes to be displayed in different ways which can help the context to be recovered, and it is easy to search. It’s also easier to make connections between different notes with tags or with links. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\">\n\n\n\n<p>Based on these experiences, I have begun to seriously fight the accumulation of unnecessary fragments and now try to only keep things that are part of a “whole”. One practice that has helped a lot is to channel the inflow of information. By default, there many different places that new files are saved, which is bad because it’s hard to evaluate what should be kept. To make things more manageable, I create a single “Inbox” folder where any new file is saved temporarily until it can be saved in an appropriate place (I got the idea from this <a href=\"https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/15677/zen-and-the-art-of-file-and-folder-organization/\">blog post</a><sup>3</sup>). This little change gave visibility to the problem, because I could easily see files building up. Now that the files were in one place, it was more straightforward to decide what to keep and what to delete (although I still put it off sometimes!). This is a small step toward protecting my digital space and being intentional about what I allow in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Limiting the amount of work in progress is also critical. Work in progress can be many things: unfinished projects, ideas that need to be pursued, or emails that need to be responded to. Too much work in progress is bad for multiple reasons (Agile frameworks like Kanban<sup>4 </sup>and Scrum<sup>5</sup> are dedicated to limiting work in progress), but in regard to storing information, the unfinished work means that there are lots of associated files and information that don’t bring joy. Instead of being sources of useful information, these incomplete files require additional work and are difficult to understand because of missing context. One tactic that helps limit the work in progress is to create a single “Current Projects” folder for things that are being actively worked on (this is another good idea from this <a href=\"https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/15677/zen-and-the-art-of-file-and-folder-organization/\">blog post</a><sup>3</sup>). With all the active work in one place it is easier to see when things are getting overwhelming. When that happens, I need to let go of things that I am never going to do and work to finish the projects that are important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Organization requires deep change in behavior. I am part of the knowledge organization system, so if the system is going to succeed then I need to be working too. This means being more intentional with what I keep and with how I keep the things that are important. The hard part is letting go. Sometimes that means deleting now and sometimes it means letting something be buried in the bottom of a list of notes. Either way this reserves the prime spots for the most useful information. As part of my system, I also need to focus on what is most important. This is a huge challenge because it requires saying “No” to some demands, and risking the disapproval of others. When those demands come from bosses, significant others, or children it’s difficult to say no. But by setting limits, I will be able to make the most of my limited resources and give the most back to those in my life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The effort is worth it for me. As I have been implementing these changes, I have found that I spend less time searching for files, notes or projects from a few months ago.

                "value": "I’m interested in building up a personal store of knowledge – good ideas, data, memories, and notes – and saving it in a way that I can quickly and easily make use of this information. Without some external way of saving things, I tend to forget them. The dream is that these ideas and pieces of information don’t have to be re-thought up or re-found each time but can be explored to rapidly generate more ideas. Ideally this would help me solve problems and help generate new knowledge for the wider society. \n\n\n\nIn reality this has turned out to be much harder than I expected. In my experience, it is easy to save information but hard to find it and make use of it later. The vast majority of my files have never been used after I saved them. When I do happen to remember a piece of information that I want to look up, I tend to have trouble finding it. This unfortunate situation surprised me. I had bought into the idea that there is essentially no cost to saving things digitally so I should save everything, and second that digital tools should make it easy to find things. I was wrong on both counts.\n\n\n\nThe difficulty of storing information became a real problem for me in grad school when I was doing research for my PhD in physics. I had to deal with countless journal articles, presentations, calculations, brainstorming sketches, experimental data, notes from talks/classes, and different versions of code (I wasn’t using version control, aaahhh!). At first, I thought my problems were just caused by the wrong organizational system. So I tried different systems, but despite having advantages and disadvantages they didn’t solve the underlying problem for me.\n\n\n\nThanks to my misadventures, I’m learning that forgetting is a feature not a bug. When I try to remember all my ideas and information, the default organizational systems struggle and while specialized tools can help they also tend to silo information. It turns out, there is a need to limit the inflow of information and the amount of work in progress. I need the information and ideas that are relevant to me, and everything else is unlikely to be needed, and should be let go. In a way my organization system for saving ideas and information is an extension of my brain. My brain is quite good at forgetting things (sometimes too good!). So while it is important to have good tools and organization, shouldn’t my system also forget things? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe default ways of organizing tend to be digital analogues to the way we store papers: papers on the desk, in notebooks, and in folders. These systems fail in similar ways to paper based systems. The simplest approach is to just put everything you need on the desktop, but this quickly fails if you have more than around ten files. The next simplest is to create notebooks; essentially storing the files in chronological order (for example by starting the filename with the date). This helps because you can quickly find a file if you remember when you worked on it, which tends to happen for things you recently worked on. However this approach makes it hard to see connections between ideas from different times1. You can’t re-arrange the ideas as you learn more; they are fixed in chronological order.\n\n\n\nThe next strategy that I’ve tried is putting files in a folder structure according to topic. This seems like a reasonable idea, but quickly becomes quicksand for ideas. Inevitably, I need to change the folder structure as I learn to better reflect the association between my files. The changes make it hard to remember where things are and breaks any references to file paths. As I create more folders, I find it difficult to remember the context underlying the relationships between folders. This can lead to folders with mashed up collections of files and sub-folders that don’t make sense. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on these struggles, I have turned to more specialized tools as a way to solve my organizational challenges. They can make a huge difference, but can create silos of information. For example, I started using Zotero in grad school, to keep track of all my research articles. This was a huge improvement over putting papers in topic based folders and trying to cram paper keywords into the filenames. Zotero has useful tools that allowed me to generate bibliographies automatically and to save papers directly from the browser. But now I had a separate store of papers that wasn’t tightly integrated with my research data and information; it was in a separate silo. This turned into a problem when I needed to reinstall my operating system. All my other files were restored but I had trouble recovering my Zotero papers. Eventually I was able to recover them, but it highlights that separate silos increase the complexity of securing my data.\n\n\n\nUltimately tools won’t help if the information is not useful. Marie Kondo says throw away all papers (except what you really need)2, and I think the same could be said for digital information too. She says this because according to her core principle, your things should “spark joy” and she finds papers rarely spark joy. Do my digital files and information spark joy? The majority probably don’t. I’m not totally sure because most are in these old folders that I never look at. \n\n\n\nInformation tends to bring me more joy when it is connected to something bigger, and this is where tools can help. For example, the “Untitled” file in an old folder called “New” is probably not useful. The context is lost; it is just a fragment. In contrast, a note in an Evernote notebook is part of something bigger. Evernote allows the notes to be displayed in different ways which can help the context to be recovered, and it is easy to search. It’s also easier to make connections between different notes with tags or with links. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on these experiences, I have begun to seriously fight the accumulation of unnecessary fragments and now try to only keep things that are part of a “whole”. One practice that has helped a lot is to channel the inflow of information. By default, there many different places that new files are saved, which is bad because it’s hard to evaluate what should be kept. To make things more manageable, I create a single “Inbox” folder where any new file is saved temporarily until it can be saved in an appropriate place (I got the idea from this blog post3). This little change gave visibility to the problem, because I could easily see files building up. Now that the files were in one place, it was more straightforward to decide what to keep and what to delete (although I still put it off sometimes!). This is a small step toward protecting my digital space and being intentional about what I allow in.\n\n\n\nLimiting the amount of work in progress is also critical. Work in progress can be many things: unfinished projects, ideas that need to be pursued, or emails that need to be responded to. Too much work in progress is bad for multiple reasons (Agile frameworks like Kanban4 and Scrum5 are dedicated to limiting work in progress), but in regard to storing information, the unfinished work means that there are lots of associated files and information that don’t bring joy. Instead of being sources of useful information, these incomplete files require additional work and are difficult to understand because of missing context. One tactic that helps limit the work in progress is to create a single “Current Projects” folder for things that are being actively worked on (this is another good idea from this blog post3). With all the active work in one place it is easier to see when things are getting overwhelming. When that happens, I need to let go of things that I am never going to do and work to finish the projects that are important.\n\n\n\nOrganization requires deep change in behavior. I am part of the knowledge organization system, so if the system is going to succeed then I need to be working too. This means being more intentional with what I keep and with how I keep the things that are important. The hard part is letting go. Sometimes that means deleting now and sometimes it means letting something be buried in the bottom of a list of notes. Either way this reserves the prime spots for the most useful information. As part of my system, I also need to focus on what is most important. This is a huge challenge because it requires saying “No” to some demands, and risking the disapproval of others. When those demands come from bosses, significant others, or children it’s difficult to say no. But by setting limits, I will be able to make the most of my limited resources and give the most back to those in my life.\n\n\n\nThe effort is worth it for me. As I have been implementing these changes, I have found that I spend less time searching for files, notes or projects from a few months ago. It still happens sometimes, but usually when I didn’t follow my own rules! My store of information is not some magically useful thing that I will use in the future, but a limited resource that I rely on and enjoy now. It has room to grow, with plenty of unneeded information that can be pruned and lots more that can be added in an integrated way.  This practice is helping me to think more clearly. Letting go of information, forgetting, is helping me to make connections between the important ideas that are left.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDavid B.

                "html": "<p>When developing software, I want to build applications quickly. In my sometimes painful experience, low quality work gets in the way of this goal. There are a lot of problems with poor code quality, but I want to focus today on how code quality is directly tied to the amount of work in progress. Low quality code leads to large work in progress which in turn causes slow and uncertain delivery time of new features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I tend to think of low quality code as any code that leads to defects that require rework, i.e. bugs. There is an inherent challenge in this definition because it’s hard to know what will cause a bug until the bug shows up. But from experience, I know there tend to be more bugs when I write the code quickly, working alone, and without writing or running tests. There are a lot of different ways to write bad code, but those are some of the common ways I do it : ).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The low quality code really starts to be a problem when I “finish” some features and move on to developing new features. The poorly written code is not really done. Most likely it still needs some rework to really function the way it is intended. So in reality, I have more work on my plate than I can handle efficiently. Major bugs crop up more frequently interrupting me and causing the time to finish any feature to increase.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It turns out that there is no way to get around the fact that more work in progress leads to longer delivery time; it’s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little%27s_law\">Little’s Law</a>. If you have a system with items coming in that have to wait in a queue before they can exit the system, then the number of items in the queue is directly proportional to how long, on average, that it takes to process a single item. This makes sense. Long lines mean long wait times.

                "value": "When developing software, I want to build applications quickly. In my sometimes painful experience, low quality work gets in the way of this goal. There are a lot of problems with poor code quality, but I want to focus today on how code quality is directly tied to the amount of work in progress. Low quality code leads to large work in progress which in turn causes slow and uncertain delivery time of new features.\n\n\n\nI tend to think of low quality code as any code that leads to defects that require rework, i.e. bugs. There is an inherent challenge in this definition because it’s hard to know what will cause a bug until the bug shows up. But from experience, I know there tend to be more bugs when I write the code quickly, working alone, and without writing or running tests. There are a lot of different ways to write bad code, but those are some of the common ways I do it : ).\n\n\n\nThe low quality code really starts to be a problem when I “finish” some features and move on to developing new features. The poorly written code is not really done. Most likely it still needs some rework to really function the way it is intended. So in reality, I have more work on my plate than I can handle efficiently. Major bugs crop up more frequently interrupting me and causing the time to finish any feature to increase.\n\n\n\nIt turns out that there is no way to get around the fact that more work in progress leads to longer delivery time; it’s Little’s Law. If you have a system with items coming in that have to wait in a queue before they can exit the system, then the number of items in the queue is directly proportional to how long, on average, that it takes to process a single item. This makes sense. Long lines mean long wait times. But when it comes to planning work, it is easy to think that I can get everything done at once.\n\n\n\nTo achieve a quicker cycle time, I need to insist on high quality work to avoid the pile of work in progress from unexpected bugs. A faster feedback cycle is super beneficial. With complex products each bit of work that we complete gives us new insight into the system, and ideally we would like to incorporate those learnings into deciding what to do next.

My older brother and I had signed up for a ski trip run by our town, and we were on a bus with a bunch of people I didn’t know. Going skiing was something I had dreamed of doing ever since watching Olympic alpine skiing as a very small child. Every winter I would sled fanatically any time it snowed, but I longed to go skiing. This was my chance!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I ended up learning how to ski quickly and loving it. My first day, my brother and I stayed on the beginner hill, but by the end we were flying down that little hill. Since then I have gone on to ski black-diamond slopes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why did I learn skiing quickly, while other people struggle greatly? Since then I have failed multiple times trying to “teach” friends how to ski. But then I have another friend, Keith, who learned how to ski even faster than me and was on black diamond slopes on his very first day!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\">\n\n\n\n<p>How people learn is a whole field of study that fascinates me.  Today, let me share a few of my thoughts about how learning works based on my own experience and from what I have picked up from reading about learning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that there are many, many mini skills that are needed to accomplish any physical skill like skiing, swimming, or even walking. Having a toddler in the house makes that very clear. My son will try all sorts of variations on manipulating objects and repeat again and again. I believe that these games help him to build up a suite of mini skills that can eventually be drawn upon to learn skills like shooting a basket or doing stand up paddle boarding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps getting stuck when attempting to learn a new skill is just a sign that one needs to learn some more of those mini skills. I had that experience with snowboarding which I tried for the first time with my friend Keith who was trying skiing. I had hoped that my experience with skiing would help me to pick up snowboarding. No luck! I kept on falling, and just felt very unstable on the board. I couldn’t turn or stop, so I had to fall. Sometimes the falls were awkward half-falls, and other times I would do a face plant into the icy snow. In the end, I gave up and switched my snowboard rental for a ski rental. Then Keith and I had a blast for the rest of the day racing down the advanced hills.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I didn’t try snowboarding again for over a decade, but when I did try snowboarding I picked it up right away and I loved it! I’m not sure how this happened, but I attribute it to learning how to do the RipStik (see the image below). A RipStick is like a skateboard but has only a single wheel at each end attached with swivel casters. To move you have to swivel you legs back and forth which somehow generates motion. It was definitely a challenge to learn but I learned it during a summer living with a group of my friends while going to Rutgers.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.razor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/RipStik_Classic_BL_Product-900x547.png?resize=670%2C407&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"RipStik_Classic_BL_Product\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" data-lazy-src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.razor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/RipStik_Classic_BL_Product-900x547.png?resize=670%2C407&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1\" srcset=\"data:image/gif;base64, http://davidbruffner.com/R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" class=\" jetpack-lazy-image\"><noscript><img data-lazy-fallback=\"1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.razor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/RipStik_Classic_BL_Product-900x547.png?resize=670%2C407&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"RipStik_Classic_BL_Product\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></noscript>\n<figcaption><a href=\"https://www.razor.com/products/ripstiks-skateboards/ripstik-caster-board/\">The Razor RipStik</a></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Somehow when I returned to snowboarding I felt like I was able to transfer some of the skills I had picked up from the RipStik.
