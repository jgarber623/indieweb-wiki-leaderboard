H. has been in existence for a decade. These numbers average out to 20 annotations to 2 articles per user. This to me suggests that the mode is 1 annotation to 1 article by a user and then silence. My 100 annotations spread out over 30 articles, accumulated over a handful of weeks is then already well above average, even though I am a new and beginning user. My introduction to h. was through Chris Aldrich, whose <a href=\"https://hypothes.is/users/chrisaldrich\">stream of annotations</a> I follow daily with interest. He recently passed 10.000 annotations! That’s 100 times as many as mine, and apparently also an outlier to the h. team itself: they sent him a <a href=\"https://boffosocko.com/2022/08/29/a-small-10000-annotations-party/\">congratulatory package</a>. H.’s marketing director has <a href=\"https://hypothes.is/users/nateangell\">1348 public annotations</a> over almost 6 years, its founder <a href=\"https://hypothes.is/users/dwhly\">1200</a> in a decade. <a href=\"https://remikalir.com/\">Remi Kalir</a>, co-author of the (readworthy!) <a href=\"https://remikalir.com/annotation-mit-press-2021/\">Annotation book</a>, has <a href=\"https://hypothes.is/users/remikalir\">800</a> in six years. That does not seem that much from what I would expect to be power users. My blogging friend <a href=\"https://hypothes.is/users/HeinzWittenbrink\">Heinz has some 750 annotations</a> in three years. Fellow IndieWeb netizen <a href=\"https://maya.land/\">Maya</a> some <a href=\"https://hypothes.is/users/mayaland\">1800</a> in a year and a half. Those last two numbers, even if they differ by a factor 5 or so in average annotations/month, feel like what I’d expect as a regular range for <em>routine</em> users. </li>\n<li>The book Annotation I mentioned makes a lot of <em>social</em> annotation, where distributed conversations result beyond the core interaction of an annotator with an author through an original text. Such social annotation <em>requires</em> sharing. H. provides that sharing functionality and positions itself explicitly as a social tool (\"<em>Annotate the web, with anyone, anywhere</em>\" \"<em>Engage your students with social annotation</em>\"). The numbers above show that such social interaction around an annotated text within h. will be very rare in the public facing part of h., in the closed (safer) surroundings of classroom use interaction might be much more prominent. Users like me, or Heinz, Maya and Chris whom I named/linked above, will then be motivated by something else than the social aspects of h. If and when such interaction does happen (as it tends to do if you mutually follow eachothers annotations) it is a pleasant addition, not h.’s central benefit.</li>\n<li>What is odd to me is that when you do indeed engage into social interaction on h., that <a href=\"https://www.zylstra.org/blog/2022/08/hypothes-is-oddity-in-retrieving-own-comments/\">interaction cannot be found through the web interface</a> of my annotations. Once I comment, it disappears out of sight, unless I remember what I reacted to and go back to that annotation by another user directly, to find my comment underneath. It does show up in the RSS feed of my annotations, and my Hypothes.is-to-Obsidian plugin also captures them through the API. Just not in the web interface.</li>\n<li>Despite the social nature of h., discovery is very difficult. Purposefully ‘finding the others’ is mostly impossible. This is both an effect of the web-interface functionality, as well as I suspect because of the relatively sparse network of users (see observation 1). There’s no direct way of connecting or searching for users. The social object is the annotation, and you need to find others only through annotations you encounter. I’ve searched for tags and terms I am interested in, but those do not surface regular users easily. I’ve <a href=\"https://www.zylstra.org/blog/hypothes-is-roll/\">collated a list</a> of a dozen currently active or somewhat active annotators, and half a dozen who used to be or are sporadically active. I also <a href=\"https://www.zylstra.org/blog/2022/08/added-hypothes-is-annotations-link-to-posts/\">added annotations of my own blogposts to my blog</a>, and I actively follow (through an RSS feed) any new annotation of my blogposts. <strong>If you use h., I’d be interested to hear about it.</strong>\n</li>\n<li>Annotations are the first step of getting useful insights into my notes. This makes it a prerequisite to be able to capture annotations in my note making tool Obsidian, otherwise Hypothes.is is just another silo you’re wasting time on. Luckily h. isn’t meant as a silo and has an API. Using the API and the Hypothes.is-to-Obsidian plugin all my annotations are available to me locally. However, what I do locally with those notes does not get reflected back to h., meaning that you can’t really work through annotations locally until you’ve annotated an entire article or paper in the browser, otherwise sync issues may occur. I also find that having the individual annotations (including the annotated text, in one file), not the full text (the stuff I didn’t annotate), feels impractical at times as it cuts away a lot of context. It’s easily retrievable by visiting the url now, but maybe not over time (so I save web archive links too as an annotation). I also grab a local markdown copy of full articles if they are of higher interest to me. Using h. in the browser creates another inbox in this regard (having to return to a thing to finish annotation or for context), and I obviously don’t need more inboxes to keep track of. </li>\n<li>In response to not saving entire articles in my notes environment, I have started marking online articles I haven’t annotated yet at least with a note that contains the motivation and first associations I normally save with a full article. This is in the same spot as where I add a web archive link, as page note. I’ve tried that in recent days and that seems to work well. That way I do have a general note in my local system that contains the motivation for looking in more detail at an article.</li>\n<li>The API also supports sending annotations and updates <em>to</em> h. from e.g. my local system. Would this be potentially better for my workflow? Firefox and the h. add-on don’t always work flawlessly, not all docs can be opened, or the form stops working until I restart Firefox. This too points in the direction of annotating locally and sending annotations to h. for sharing through the API. Is there anyone already doing this? Built their own client, or using h. ‘headless’? Is there anyone who runs their own h. instance locally? If I could send things through the API, that might also include the Kindle highlights I pull in to my local system. </li>\n<li>In the same category of integrating h. into my pkm workflows, falls the interaction between h. and Zotero, especially now that Zotero has its own storage of annotations of PDFs in my library.  It might be of interest to be able to share those annotations, for a more complete overview of what I’m annotating. Either directly from Zotero, or by way of my notes in Obsidian (Zotero annotatins end up there in the end)</li>\n<li>These first 100 annotations I made in the browser, using an add-on. Annotating in the browser takes some getting used to, as I try to get myself out of my browser more usually. I don’t always fully realise I can return to an article for later annotation. Any time the sense I have to finish annotating an article surfaces, that is friction I can do without. Apart from that, it is a pleasant experience to annotate like this. And that pleasure is key to keep annotating. Being able to better integrate my h. use with Obsidian and Zotero would likely increase the pleasure of doing it.</li>\n<li>Another path of integration to think about is sharing annotated links from h. to my blog or the other way around. I blog links with a general annotation at times (<a href=\"https://www.zylstra.org/blog/2022/08/22073/\">example</a>). These  bloggable links I could grab from h. where I bookmark things in similar ways (<a href=\"https://via.hypothes.is/https://flowingdata.com/2022/09/01/looking-for-meaning-in-the-everyday/#annotations:5JMGfioIEe2G_9uPa5Qe8Q\">example</a>), usually to annotate further later on. I notice myself thinking I should do both, but unless I could do that simultaneously  I won’t do such a thing twice.</li>\n</ol>",

This too points in the direction of annotating locally and sending annotations to h. for sharing through the API. Is there anyone already doing this? Built their own client, or using h. ‘headless’? Is there anyone who runs their own h. instance locally? If I could send things through the API, that might also include the Kindle highlights I pull in to my local system. \nIn the same category of integrating h. into my pkm workflows, falls the interaction between h. and Zotero, especially now that Zotero has its own storage of annotations of PDFs in my library.  It might be of interest to be able to share those annotations, for a more complete overview of what I’m annotating. Either directly from Zotero, or by way of my notes in Obsidian (Zotero annotatins end up there in the end)\nThese first 100 annotations I made in the browser, using an add-on. Annotating in the browser takes some getting used to, as I try to get myself out of my browser more usually. I don’t always fully realise I can return to an article for later annotation. Any time the sense I have to finish annotating an article surfaces, that is friction I can do without. Apart from that, it is a pleasant experience to annotate like this. And that pleasure is key to keep annotating. Being able to better integrate my h. use with Obsidian and Zotero would likely increase the pleasure of doing it.\nAnother path of integration to think about is sharing annotated links from h. to my blog or the other way around. I blog links with a general annotation at times (example). These  bloggable links I could grab from h. where I bookmark things in similar ways (example), usually to annotate further later on. I notice myself thinking I should do both, but unless I could do that simultaneously  I won’t do such a thing twice."
