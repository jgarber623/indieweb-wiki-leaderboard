H. has been in existence for a decade. These numbers average out to 20 annotations to 2 articles per user. This to me suggests that the mode is 1 annotation to 1 article by a user and then silence. My 100 annotations spread out over 30 articles, accumulated over a handful of weeks is then already well above average, even though I am a new and beginning user. My introduction to h. was through Chris Aldrich, whose <a href=\"https://hypothes.is/users/chrisaldrich\">stream of annotations</a> I follow daily with interest. He recently passed 10.000 annotations! That’s 100 times as many as mine, and apparently also an outlier to the h. team itself: they sent him a <a href=\"https://boffosocko.com/2022/08/29/a-small-10000-annotations-party/\">congratulatory package</a>. H.’s marketing director has <a href=\"https://hypothes.is/users/nateangell\">1348 public annotations</a> over almost 6 years, its founder <a href=\"https://hypothes.is/users/dwhly\">1200</a> in a decade. <a href=\"https://remikalir.com/\">Remi Kalir</a>, co-author of the (readworthy!) <a href=\"https://remikalir.com/annotation-mit-press-2021/\">Annotation book</a>, has <a href=\"https://hypothes.is/users/remikalir\">800</a> in six years. That does not seem that much from what I would expect to be power users. My blogging friend <a href=\"https://hypothes.is/users/HeinzWittenbrink\">Heinz has some 750 annotations</a> in three years. Fellow IndieWeb netizen <a href=\"https://maya.land/\">Maya</a> some <a href=\"https://hypothes.is/users/mayaland\">1800</a> in a year and a half. Those last two numbers, even if they differ by a factor 5 or so in average annotations/month, feel like what I’d expect as a regular range for <em>routine</em> users. </li>\n<li>The book Annotation I mentioned makes a lot of <em>social</em> annotation, where distributed conversations result beyond the core interaction of an annotator with an author through an original text. Such social annotation <em>requires</em> sharing. H. provides that sharing functionality and positions itself explicitly as a social tool (\"<em>Annotate the web, with anyone, anywhere</em>\" \"<em>Engage your students with social annotation</em>\"). The numbers above show that such social interaction around an annotated text within h. will be very rare in the public facing part of h., in the closed (safer) surroundings of classroom use interaction might be much more prominent. Users like me, or Heinz, Maya and Chris whom I named/linked above, will then be motivated by something else than the social aspects of h. If and when such interaction does happen (as it tends to do if you mutually follow eachothers annotations) it is a pleasant addition, not h.’s central benefit.</li>\n<li>What is odd to me is that when you do indeed engage into social interaction on h., that <a href=\"https://www.zylstra.org/blog/2022/08/hypothes-is-oddity-in-retrieving-own-comments/\">interaction cannot be found through the web interface</a> of my annotations. Once I comment, it disappears out of sight, unless I remember what I reacted to and go back to that annotation by another user directly, to find my comment underneath.

Just not in the web interface.</li>\n<li>Despite the social nature of h., discovery is very difficult. Purposefully ‘finding the others’ is mostly impossible. This is both an effect of the web-interface functionality, as well as I suspect because of the relatively sparse network of users (see observation 1). There’s no direct way of connecting or searching for users. The social object is the annotation, and you need to find others only through annotations you encounter. I’ve searched for tags and terms I am interested in, but those do not surface regular users easily. I’ve <a href=\"https://www.zylstra.org/blog/hypothes-is-roll/\">collated a list</a> of a dozen currently active or somewhat active annotators, and half a dozen who used to be or are sporadically active. I also <a href=\"https://www.zylstra.org/blog/2022/08/added-hypothes-is-annotations-link-to-posts/\">added annotations of my own blogposts to my blog</a>, and I actively follow (through an RSS feed) any new annotation of my blogposts. <strong>If you use h., I’d be interested to hear about it.</strong>\n</li>\n<li>Annotations are the first step of getting useful insights into my notes.

However, what I do locally with those notes does not get reflected back to h., meaning that you can’t really work through annotations locally until you’ve annotated an entire article or paper in the browser, otherwise sync issues may occur. I also find that having the individual annotations (including the annotated text, in one file), not the full text (the stuff I didn’t annotate), feels impractical at times as it cuts away a lot of context. It’s easily retrievable by visiting the url now, but maybe not over time (so I save web archive links too as an annotation).
