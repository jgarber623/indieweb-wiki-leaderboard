Well over 3000 posts later, this blog has been an integral part of quite a stretch of my life, to the point where it is <a href=\"https://www.zylstra.org/blog/2020/08/your-blog-is-your-avatar/\">unavoidable</a> that if you’ve read along you now probably know more about me than I think I’ve actually shared in writing.</p>\n<p>In the past few years I’ve taken this blog’s anniversary as a moment to reflect on some of my blogging practices. That yearly reflection started <a href=\"https://www.zylstra.org/blog/2017/11/15-years-of-blogging/\">5 years ago</a> when I was just leaving Facebook. This time it coincides with <a href=\"https://www.zylstra.org/blog/2022/10/twitter-after-the-birds-capture-find-me-at-tonm-tzyl-nl/\">#twittermigration</a>, where many people are exploring federated options now that Musk has taken over Twitter. Whether that is something that will stick is uncertain of course, but it is interesting to watch playing out. Other earlier such reflections: <a href=\"https://www.zylstra.org/blog/2018/11/sixteen-years-of-blogging/\">2018</a>, <a href=\"https://www.zylstra.org/blog/2019/11/17-years-of-blogging/\">2019</a>, <a href=\"https://www.zylstra.org/blog/2020/11/18-years-of-blogging-the-stay-at-home-edition/\">2020</a>, <a href=\"https://www.zylstra.org/blog/2021/11/19-years-of-blogging-the-still-at-home-edition/\">2021</a>.</p>\n<p>Last year I wrote:</p>\n<blockquote><p>For the coming time this note-to-blog pipeline, and making it easier for myself to post, will be my area of attention I think. Let’s see next year around this time, when I hit the two decade mark with this blog, how that went.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Indeed, that is exactly what I did from early this year: ensure that I could post directly to this blog in different ways.

                "value": "Today at 14:07 twenty years ago, I posted my first blog post. Well over 3000 posts later, this blog has been an integral part of quite a stretch of my life, to the point where it is unavoidable that if you’ve read along you now probably know more about me than I think I’ve actually shared in writing.\nIn the past few years I’ve taken this blog’s anniversary as a moment to reflect on some of my blogging practices. That yearly reflection started 5 years ago when I was just leaving Facebook. This time it coincides with #twittermigration, where many people are exploring federated options now that Musk has taken over Twitter. Whether that is something that will stick is uncertain of course, but it is interesting to watch playing out.
